      "Five Short StoriesAlphonse DaudetThe Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction, Vol. XIII, Part 4.Selected by Charles William EliotCopyright © 2001 Bartleby.com, Inc.Bibliographic RecordContentsBiographical NoteCriticisms and InterpretationsI. By Henry JamesII. By George Pellissier1. The Siege of Berlin2. The Last ClassŠThe Story of a Little Alsatian3. The Child Spy4. The Game of Billiards5. The Bad ZouaveBiographical NoteALPHONSE DAUDET was born at Nîmes in the south of France on May 13, 1840. His father was anunsuccessful silk manufacturer, and his boyhood was far from happy. After a period of schooling atLyons, he became at sixteen usher in a school, but before the end of the following year he abandoned aprofession in which he found only misery. Going up to Paris he joined his elder brother, Ernest, who wasthen trying to get a foothold in journalism. At eighteen he published a volume of poems, ﬁLesAmoureuses,ﬂ wrote for the ﬁFigaro,ﬂ and began experimenting with playwriting. He attracted theattention of the Duc de Morny, who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in life.  His first notable success came in 1866 with his ﬁLettres de mon Moulin,ﬂ a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, ﬁLe petit chose,ﬂ apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth. In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing ﬁTartarin of Tarascon,ﬂ probably the most vital of all his creations. In ﬁFromont jeune etRisler aînéﬂ he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive thereading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types. Pathoswas again the chief characteristic of ﬁJack,ﬂ in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recallsthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.  Daudet was now a successful writer of established reputation, and through the seventies and eighties hewrote a succession of novels of a considerable variety of theme. Thus he dealt with the Paris ofdethroned monarchs in ﬁLes Rois en exilﬂ; with new millionaires in ﬁLe Nababﬂ; with the talkative typeof his native South in ﬁNuma Roumestan,ﬂ satirizing the statesman Gambetta; with the demimonde inﬁSaphoﬂ; while in ﬁL™Immortelﬂ he drew a scathing picture of the French Academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership. ﬁTartarinﬂ reappeared in all his buoyancy in ﬁTartarin surles Alpes,ﬂ and, less successfully as a colonist in ﬁPort-Tarascon.ﬂ Some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings. He died at Paris on December 17, 1897.  Daudet was especially distinguished for his style. He wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.  None of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called ﬁContes dulundiﬂ from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.The horrors of the Franco-Prussian War have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.ﬁThe Siege of Berlin,ﬂ ﬁThe Last Class,ﬂ and ﬁThe Bad Zouaveﬂ are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of French patriotism.W. A. N.Criticisms and InterpretationsI. By Henry JamesTHE CHARM of Daudet™s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities. This, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous. To Alphonse Daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords. A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionŠthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.ŠFrom ﬁPartial Portraitsﬂ (1888).Criticisms and InterpretationsII. By George PellissierDAUDET works in a sort of fever. Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost ﬁlivedﬂ them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition. The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments. Only with that ﬁtrembling of the fingers,ﬂ with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen. He at once launches into the full current of the action. Ashis figures are already ﬁon foot in his mind,ﬂ he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. Thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène. He renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibrationŠwhat is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.ŠFrom ﬁThe Literary Movement in France in the NineteenthCenturyﬂ (1893).1. The Siege of BerlinWE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. VŠŠ, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached theRond-point de l™Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:  ﬁDo you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, thatterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case ofapoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.Poor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he readthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.  ﬁI found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.  ﬁThe child™s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon™sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. Youremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  ﬁ‚Vic-to-ry!™  ﬁAnd as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.  ﬁWhen I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.  ﬁ‚But he is saved!™ I said, taking her hands.  ﬁThe unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;MacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was indespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this freshshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But inthat case we must lie.  ﬁ‚Very well, I will lie!™ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather™s chamber.  ﬁIt was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The goodman™s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health hisideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazainebesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and Iassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‚Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do™; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.  ﬁUnlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.That old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.  ﬁ‚Doctor, we have taken Mayence,™ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  ﬁ‚They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!™  ﬁAt that moment the Prussians were only a week™s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.  ﬁThe first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.  ﬁ‚Well,™ he said, ‚so the siege has begun!™  ﬁI gazed at him in blank amazement.  ﬁ‚What, colonel! you know?™  ﬁHis granddaughter turned towards me:  ﬁ‚Why, yes, doctor, that™s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.™  ﬁAs she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspectedanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby™s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;Šand all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.  ﬁFrom that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter ofpatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hissonŠan imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,MacMahon™s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‚Never forget that you are a Frenchman,™ hewould say to him. ‚Be generous to those poor people. Don™t make the invasion too hard for them.™ Andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.  ﬁ‚A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turnGermany into France?™  ﬁHe dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.  ﬁMeanwhile the siege went onŠnot the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man™s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. Tothe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfishŠthe old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.  ﬁ‚Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!™  ﬁI rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.That numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindowŠit was, I believe, the Thursday of BuzenvalŠhe saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.  ﬁ‚What are all those troops?™ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  ﬁ‚Poorly set up! Poorly set up!™  ﬁThat was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did nottake enough.  ﬁOne evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.  ﬁ‚They are to march into the city to-morrow,™ she said.  ﬁWas the grandfather™s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talkingof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so longŠMacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.  ﬁPoor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofMilhaud™s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.  ﬁFor a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.  ﬁBut no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jenabegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, Schubert™s Triumphal March burst forth!  ﬁThereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‚To arms! To arms! ThePrussians!™ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.ﬂ2. The Last ClassŠThe Story of a Little AlsatianI WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thingabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It wassuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in theRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as Icould to school.  As I passed the mayor™s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that boardŠbattles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:  ﬁWhat can it be now?ﬂ  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  ﬁDon™t hurry so, my boy; you™ll get to your school soon enough!ﬂ  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel™s little yard all out of breath.  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher™s stout ruler beating on the desk:  ﬁA little more quiet!ﬂ  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, andMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I wasafraid!  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  ﬁGo at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.ﬂ  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.Moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  ﬁMy children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothingbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the lastclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.ﬂ  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor™soffice.  My last class in French!  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry Iwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarryŠmy grammar, my sacred historyŠseemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should beterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was goingaway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and Iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What wouldI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:  ﬁI will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‚Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.™ And then you see whathappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‚What! you claim to be French, and you canneither speak nor write your language!™ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.  ﬁYour parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproachmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to gofishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?ﬂ  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the Frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, ﬁso long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.ﬂ 1 Then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: ﬁFrance, Alsace, France, Alsace.ﬂThey were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and I said to myself as I listened to them:  ﬁI wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!ﬂ  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! Forthey were to go away the next dayŠto leave the province forever.  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, oldHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of thePrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.  ﬁMy friends,ﬂ he said, ﬁmy friends, IŠIŠﬂ  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  ﬁVIVE LA FRANCE!ﬂ  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  ﬁThat is all; go.ﬂ3. The Child SpyHIS name was Stenne, little Stenne.  He was a child of Paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell. His mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he Temple quarter. Babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingParis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew Father Stenne andadored him. They knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  ﬁHow™s your little boy?ﬂ  Father Stenne was so fond of his boy! He was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.  Unfortunately with the siege everything changed. Father Stenne™s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home. So that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the Prussians. As for littleStenne, he did not complain™ very much of that new life.  A siege! It is such an amusing thing for urchins. No school! No lessons! Vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.  The child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night. He followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little Stenne was well posted. He could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one. At other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.  With his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers™ and bakers™ shops. There, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as M. Stenne™s son. But the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the Breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege. When little Stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker™s, you were sure to find him at the game on Place du Château d™Eau. He did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money. He contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!  One especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration. When he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.  One day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little Stenne™s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  ﬁThat makes you squint, eh? Well, I will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.ﬂ  When the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the Prussians; he received thirty francs per trip. At first Stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days. Three terrible days. He did not eat,he did not sleep. At night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening. The temptation was too great. On the fourth day he returned to the Château d™Eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.  They set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, When they reached the Flanders gate it was barely light. The tall youth took Stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentryŠan honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expressionŠhesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  ﬁLet us pass, my kind monsieur. Our mother is sick, papa is dead, I am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.ﬂ  And he wept. Stenne, covered with shame, hung his head. The sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.  ﬁHurry up,ﬂ he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the Aubervilliers Road. How the tallfellow laughed!  Confusedly, as in a dream, little Stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken. Atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires. The tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts. However, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid. The sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the Soissons railroad. That time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass. Then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledFather Stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.  ﬁCome, little brats, I wouldn™t cry!ﬂ he said to the children; ﬁwe™ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first. This little fellow looks as if he was frozen!ﬂ  Alas! It was not with cold that little Stenne was tremblingŠit was with fear, with shame. In theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow™s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets. They moved closer together tomake room for the children. They gave them a little coffee. While they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.  ﬁMY boys,ﬂ said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, ﬁthere will be something up to-night. Theyhave found out the Prussians™ countersign. I believe that this time we shall capture that infernal Bourgetagain.ﬂ  There was a explosion of cheers and laughter. They danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.  When they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes. It was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.  ﬁLet™s go back, let™s not go on,ﬂ said little Stenne again and again.  The other shrugged his shoulders and kept on. Suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.  ﬁLie down!ﬂ said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.  When they were down, he whistled. Another whistled. Another whistle answered over the snow. Theycrawled on. In front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap. The tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the Prussian.  ﬁThis is my brother,ﬂ he said, pointing to his companion.  Little Stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the Prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.  On the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.  In the corner was a gardener™s house casemated with trunks of trees. The lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire. The cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters! Above were the officers. They could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne. When the Parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them. Theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk. All the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetArab™s vocabulary. They laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theParisian mud which he brought them.  Little Stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim. Opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver Prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little Stenne. Affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as Stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  ﬁI would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.ﬂ  From that moment Stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.  To escape that torture, he began to drink. Soon everything about him whirled around. He heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the National Guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the Marais, a night alarm on the ramparts. Then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious. The villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.  At that little Stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  ﬁNot that! I won™t have it!ﬂ  But the other simply laughed and kept on. Before he had finished, all the officers were standing. One ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  ﬁClear out!ﬂ  And they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in German.  The tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money. Stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the Prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  ﬁNot a nice thing to do, that. Not a nice thing.ﬂ  Tears came to his eyes.  Once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city. Their bag was full ofpotatoes which the Prussians had given them. With them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters. There they were preparing for the night attack. Troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls. The old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression. When the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.  Oh! how that smile hurt little Stenne! For a moment he was tempted to call out:  ﬁDon™t go there; we have betrayed you.ﬂ  But the other had told him: ﬁIf you speak we shall be shotﬂ; and fear restrained him.  At La Courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money. Truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little Stenne™s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.  But when he was alone, the wretched child! When the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever. Paris didnot seem the same to him. The people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.He heard the word ﬁspyﬂ in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal. Atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.  Never had Father Stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night. Newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better. As he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  ﬁI say, my boy, how you would go at the Prussians if you were big!ﬂ  Above eight o™clock, they heard cannon.  ﬁThat is Aubervilliers. They are fighting at Bourget,ﬂ said the good man, who knew all the forts. LittleStenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep. Thecannon still roared. He imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the Prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush. He remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him. The price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of Monsieur Stenne, of a soldierŠtears choked him. In theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it. Below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city. Evidently it was a real battle. The unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.  ﬁWhat™s the matter with you?ﬂ asked Father Stenne as he entered the room.  The child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father™s feet. Atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.  ﬁWhat is all this? Have you been stealing?ﬂ demanded the old man, trembling.  Thereupon, without pausing for breath, little Stenne told him that he had been to the Prussian quartersand of what he had done there.  As he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself. Father Stenne listened, with a terribleface. When it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.  ﬁFather, fatherŠﬂ the child began.  The old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.  ﬁIs this all?ﬂ he asked.  Little Stenne motioned that it was all. The old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  ﬁAll right; I am going to return it to them.ﬂ  And without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness. He was never seen again.4. The Game of BilliardsAS they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted. And yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.  Benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another. There are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour™s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep. Rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.It is funereal.  What are they doing there? What is going on? The guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something. The mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.Everything seems ready for an attack. Why do they not attack? What are they waiting for?  They are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none. And yet the headquarters are not far away. Theyare at yonder stately Louis-Treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill. Truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of France.Behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch. On the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage. Although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war. The oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.  The rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans. Everything glistens,everything is peaceful. Really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army. The horses are resting inthe stables. Here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.  The dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.In the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses. The marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.When the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.  Billiards! that is the weakness of that great warrior. He stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game. His aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful. uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes. When the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog. There is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at Compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.  The marshal™s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily. He is what is called an officer with a future.  Attention, young man, let us be on our guard! The marshal has fifteen, and you ten. The point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.  It is really an interesting game. The balls roll and clash and mingle their colours. The cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot. Suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky. A dullsound rattles the windows. Everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously. The marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.  But there comes another flash, then another. The cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste. Theaides-de-camp run to the windows. Can it be that the Prussians are attacking.  ﬁVery well, let them attack!ﬂ says the marshal, chalking his cue. ﬁIt™s your turn, captain.ﬂ  The staff quivers with admiration. Turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action. Meanwhile the uproarredoubles. With the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry. A red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns. The whole park is on fire. The terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the Arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.The headquarters begins to be excited. Despatch after despatch. Couriers arrive at full speed. They askfor the marshal.  The marshal cannot be seen. Did I not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?  ﬁIt is your turn, captain.ﬂ  But the captain is distraught. That is what it is to be young. Behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game. Thereupon the marshal becomesfurious. Surprise and indignation animate his manly face. Just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard. An aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound. ﬁMarshal, marshal!ﬂ You should see how he is greeted. Puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  ﬁWhat™s the matter? What™s all this? Isn™t there any sentry there?ﬂ  ﬁBut, marshalŠŠﬂ  ﬁAll right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in God™s name!ﬂ  And the window is violently closed.  Wait for his orders! That is just what they are doing, the poor fellows. The wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces. Whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction. Nothing to do. They are awaiting orders.However, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château. Even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of France flows noiselessly. Above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.  Seventeen! eighteen! nineteen!  They hardly have time to mark the points. The roar of the battle draws nearer. The marshal has but onemore to go. Already shells are falling in the park. Suddenly one bursts over the pond. The mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers. That is the laststroke.  Then, a profound silence. Only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock. The army is in full retreat.The marshal has won his game.5. The Bad ZouaveTHAT evening the big blacksmith, Lory of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, was not happy.  When the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day™s work. Beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.  But that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave. As his old wife looked at him, she thought.  ﬁWhat can have happened to him? Can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me? Perhaps the older of the boys is sickŠŠﬂ  But she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.  At last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  ﬁAh, what brutes, what curs!ﬂ  ﬁCome, Lory, who are you talking about?ﬂ said his wife. He shouted,  ﬁI am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their Frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the BavariansŠmore of those fellows who haveŠhow do they sayit?Š‚chosen Prussian citizenship.™ And to think that every day we seeing such false Alsatians comeback! What can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?ﬂ  The mother tried to defend them.  ﬁMy poor husband, what do you expect? Those boys are not entirely to blame. They are sent to Algeria,so far away in Africa! They get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.ﬂ  Lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.  ﬁBe still, mother! You women-folk understand nothing at all. You live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs. I tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels! If bad luck ever made our own Christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is George Lory, seven years chasseur in the army ofFrance, I would run him through the body with my saber!ﬂ  Terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur™s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in Africa.  But merely to look at that honest Alsatian face,Šburned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness aroundŠthat was enough to quiet himsuddenly. He began to laugh.  ﬁI am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way! As if our Christian could dream of turningPrussianŠChristian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!ﬂ  Brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the Ville de Strasbourg.  The old woman was now left alone. She had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep. She picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house. Once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  ﬁOf courseŠthere can be no doubt of itŠthey are scoundrels and renegadesŠbut, what of it? Theirmothers are glad to see them again.ﬂ  And she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden. She looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the Zouaves.  Suddenly she trembled. The little gate at the backŠthe gate which led to the fields,Šhad been opened.The dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.  ﬁGood-day, mother!ﬂ  His uniform all awry, there stood before her Christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued. The wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out. She wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.How long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him! And then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!Šhow he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:Šweary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the disciplineŠmuch harsher of lateŠas well as of hiscomrades, who called him ﬁPrussianﬂ because of his Alsatian accent. She believed every word he said.She had only to look at him to believe him. Deep in their talk, they went into the lower room. The littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother. He was urged to eat,but he was not hungry. He was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.  But some one was coming into the yard. It was the black-smith returning.  ﬁChristian, here comes your father. Quick, hide until I have time to talk with him and explain.ﬂ  She pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands. But as ill fortune would have it, the Zouave™s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thingLory noticed as he entered. The mother™s pallor, and her agitationŠhe understood it all.  ﬁChristian is here!ﬂ he cried, in a terrible voice. Taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the Zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.  The mother threw herself between them.  ﬁLory, Lory! Don™t kill him! He came back because I wrote that you needed him at the forge!ﬂ  She riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing. The children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.  The smith stood still and looked at his wife.  ﬁOh!ﬂ he said. ﬁSo it was you who made him come back! Very well. It is time he went to bed. I shalldecide to-morrow what I must do.ﬂ  Christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child. Already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window. Hammers wereringing on the anvil below. His mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband™s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night. Nor had the father gone to bed. Till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets. He now entered his son™s room.He was very grave and dressed for a journey. He wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule. He went straight to the bed.  ﬁCome, get up!ﬂ  Dazed, the boy made as if to get his Zouave equipment.  ﬁNo, not that!ﬂ said the father, sternly.  The mother, all apprehension, said,  ﬁBut, my dear, he has no other things.ﬂ  ﬁGive him mine. I shall not need them again.ﬂ  While the boy dressed, Lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.As soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.  ﬁNow let us go down,ﬂ he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.  The blast roared. Everyone was at work. When Christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in Algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.He felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.  At last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.  ﬁBoy,ﬂ he said, ﬁthere stands the anvil with the tools. They are all yours. And so is all this.ﬂ Heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.  ﬁThe hives, the vine, the house itself,Šthey are all yours. You sacrificed your honour for these things.The least you can do is to take care of them. Now you are master here. As for myself, I shall go away.You owe five years to France: I am going to pay them for you.ﬂ  ﬁLory, Lory!™ cried the poor old wife, ﬁwhere are you going?ﬂ  ﬁFather!ﬂ begged the son.  But the blacksmith was already on his way. He walked with great strides and did not turn back.  At Sidi-bel-Abbés, the dépôt of the Third Zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years.FootnotesNote 1.  ﬁS™il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.ﬂŠMistral.

       "'Five Short StoriesAlphonse DaudetThe Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction, Vol. XIII, Part 4.Selected by Charles William EliotCopyright © 2001 Bartleby.com, Inc.Bibliographic RecordContentsBiographical NoteCriticisms and InterpretationsI. By Henry JamesII. By George Pellissier1. The Siege of Berlin2. The Last ClassŠThe Story of a Little Alsatian3. The Child Spy4. The Game of Billiards5. The Bad ZouaveBiographical NoteALPHONSE DAUDET was born at Nîmes in the south of France on May 13, 1840. His father was anunsuccessful silk manufacturer, and his boyhood was far from happy. After a period of schooling atLyons, he became at sixteen usher in a school, but before the end of the following year he abandoned aprofession in which he found only misery. Going up to Paris he joined his elder brother, Ernest, who wasthen trying to get a foothold in journalism. At eighteen he published a volume of poems, ﬁLesAmoureuses,ﬂ wrote for the ﬁFigaro,ﬂ and began experimenting with playwriting. He attracted theattention of the Duc de Morny, who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in life.  His first notable success came in 1866 with his ﬁLettres de mon Moulin,ﬂ a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, ﬁLe petit chose,ﬂ apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth. In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing ﬁTartarin of Tarascon,ﬂ probably the most vital of all his creations. In ﬁFromont jeune etRisler aînéﬂ he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive thereading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types. Pathoswas again the chief characteristic of ﬁJack,ﬂ in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recallsthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.  Daudet was now a successful writer of established reputation, and through the seventies and eighties hewrote a succession of novels of a considerable variety of theme. Thus he dealt with the Paris ofdethroned monarchs in ﬁLes Rois en exilﬂ; with new millionaires in ﬁLe Nababﬂ; with the talkative typeof his native South in ﬁNuma Roumestan,ﬂ satirizing the statesman Gambetta; with the demimonde inﬁSaphoﬂ; while in ﬁL™Immortelﬂ he drew a scathing picture of the French Academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership. ﬁTartarinﬂ reappeared in all his buoyancy in ﬁTartarin surles Alpes,ﬂ and, less successfully as a colonist in ﬁPort-Tarascon.ﬂ Some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings. He died at Paris on December 17, 1897.  Daudet was especially distinguished for his style. He wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity. He belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.  None of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called ﬁContes dulundiﬂ from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.The horrors of the Franco-Prussian War have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.ﬁThe Siege of Berlin,ﬂ ﬁThe Last Class,ﬂ and ﬁThe Bad Zouaveﬂ are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of French patriotism.W. A. N.Criticisms and InterpretationsI. By Henry JamesTHE CHARM of Daudet™s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities. This, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous. To Alphonse Daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords. A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionŠthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.ŠFrom ﬁPartial Portraitsﬂ (1888).Criticisms and InterpretationsII. By George PellissierDAUDET works in a sort of fever. Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost ﬁlivedﬂ them. This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition. The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor. He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts. The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments. Only with that ﬁtrembling of the fingers,ﬂ with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen. He at once launches into the full current of the action. Ashis figures are already ﬁon foot in his mind,ﬂ he loses no time in introducing them in full activity. Thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène. He renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibrationŠwhat is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.ŠFrom ﬁThe Literary Movement in France in the NineteenthCenturyﬂ (1893).1. The Siege of BerlinWE were going up Avenue des Champs-Elysées with Dr. VŠŠ, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of Paris, when, just before we reached theRond-point de l™Etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the Arc de Triomphe, said to me:  ﬁDo you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony? In the early days of August, thatterrible August of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, I was called there to see a case ofapoplexy. It was the apartment of Colonel Jouve, a cuirassier of the First Empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the Champs-Élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war. Guess why? In order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.Poor old fellow! The news of Wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table. When he readthe name of Napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.  ﬁI found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe. He must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous. Handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty. Beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears. She looked like him. One who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful Greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.  ﬁThe child™s grief touched me. Daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on MacMahon™sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible. I comforted her as best I could, but in reality I had little hope. We had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it. For three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor. Then the news of Reichshofen reached Paris. Youremember in what a strange way it came. Up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand Prussians killed and the Prince Royal a prisoner. I know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when I approached his bed, I did not find the same man there. His eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy. He had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  ﬁ‚Vic-to-ry!™  ﬁAnd as I gave him details of the grand exploit of MacMahon, I saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.  ﬁWhen I left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death. She was sobbing.  ﬁ‚But he is saved!™ I said, taking her hands.  ﬁThe unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply. The true report of Reichshofen had been placarded;MacMahon in retreat, the whole army crushed. We gazed at each other in consternation. She was indespair, thinking of her father. I trembled, thinking of the old man. He certainly could not stand this freshshock. And yet what were we to do? Leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him? But inthat case we must lie.  ﬁ‚Very well, I will lie!™ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather™s chamber.  ﬁIt was a hard task that she had undertaken. The first few days she had no great difficulty. The goodman™s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child. But with returning health hisideas became clearer. We had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him. Really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of Germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: Bazainebesieging Berlin, Froissart in Bavaria, MacMahon on the Baltic. For all this she asked my advice, and Iassisted her as well as I could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion. He had conquered Germany so many times under the First Empire! He knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‚Now this is where they will go. Now this is what they will do™; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.  ﬁUnlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.That old man was insatiable! Every day, when I arrived, I learned of some new military exploit.  ﬁ‚Doctor, we have taken Mayence,™ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and I would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  ﬁ‚They are getting on! They are getting on! In a week we shall be in Berlin!™  ﬁAt that moment the Prussians were only a week™s march from Paris. We asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and I considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth. So we decided to remain.  ﬁThe first day of the investment of Paris, I went up to their rooms, I remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all. I found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.  ﬁ‚Well,™ he said, ‚so the siege has begun!™  ﬁI gazed at him in blank amazement.  ﬁ‚What, colonel! you know?™  ﬁHis granddaughter turned towards me:  ﬁ‚Why, yes, doctor, that™s the great news. The siege of Berlin has begun.™  ﬁAs she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air! How could he have suspectedanything? He could not hear the guns of the forts. He could not see our unfortunate Paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold. What he saw from his bed was a section of the Arc de Triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the First Empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion. Portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the King of Rome in a baby™s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of St. Helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;Šand all these things: consoles, King of Rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806. Gallant colonel! It was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of Berlin.  ﬁFrom that day our military operations were much simplified. To take Berlin was only a matter ofpatience. From time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hissonŠan imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter Paris, and since Sedan,MacMahon™s aide-de-camp had been sent to a German fortress. You can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country. Sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks. But the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep. Thereupon a letter from Germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears. The colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused. But where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son. ‚Never forget that you are a Frenchman,™ hewould say to him. ‚Be generous to those poor people. Don™t make the invasion too hard for them.™ Andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors. He interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished. Thereupon I must say that he was not exacting.  ﬁ‚A war indemnity, and nothing more. What is the use of taking their provinces? Is it possible to turnGermany into France?™  ﬁHe dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.  ﬁMeanwhile the siege went onŠnot the siege of Berlin, alas! It was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine. But, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man™s serenity was not disturbed for an instant. Tothe very end I was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him. There was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfishŠthe old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things. Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.  ﬁ‚Do you understand that, my love? We had horseflesh!™  ﬁI rather think that she did understand it. For two months she had had nothing else. From that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.That numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear. Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides. Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindowŠit was, I believe, the Thursday of BuzenvalŠhe saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.  ﬁ‚What are all those troops?™ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  ﬁ‚Poorly set up! Poorly set up!™  ﬁThat was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth. Unluckily we did nottake enough.  ﬁOne evening when I arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.  ﬁ‚They are to march into the city to-morrow,™ she said.  ﬁWas the grandfather™s door open? In truth, on thinking it over afterwards, I remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night. It is probable that he had overheard us. But we were talkingof the Prussians; and the good man was thinking of the French, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so longŠMacMahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at Lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.  ﬁPoor Father Jouve! He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement. So he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the Prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from Porte Maillot to the Tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofMilhaud™s cuirassiers. I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness. This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.  ﬁFor a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.  ﬁBut no! Yonder, behind the Arc de Triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight. Then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of Jenabegan to beat, and beneath the Arc de Triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, Schubert™s Triumphal March burst forth!  ﬁThereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‚To arms! To arms! ThePrussians!™ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall. That time, Colonel Jouve was really dead.ﬂ2. The Last ClassŠThe Story of a Little AlsatianI WAS very late for school that morning, and I was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asMonsieur Hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and I did not know the first thingabout them. For a moment I thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields. It wassuch a warm, lovely day. I could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in theRippert field, behind the sawmill, the Prussians going through their drill. All that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but I had the strength to resist, and I ran as fast as Icould to school.  As I passed the mayor™s office, I saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted. For two years all our bad news had come from that boardŠbattles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and I thought without stopping:  ﬁWhat can it be now?ﬂ  Then, as I ran across the square, Wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  ﬁDon™t hurry so, my boy; you™ll get to your school soon enough!ﬂ  I thought that he was making fun of me, and I ran into Monsieur Hamel™s little yard all out of breath.  Usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher™s stout ruler beating on the desk:  ﬁA little more quiet!ﬂ  I counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a Sunday morning. Through the open window I saw my comrades already in their places, andMonsieur Hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence. You can imagine whether I blushed and whether I wasafraid!  But no! Monsieur Hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  ﬁGo at once to your seat, my little Frantz; we were going to begin without you.ﬂ  I stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk. Not until then, when I had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did I notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.Moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class. But whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old Hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides. They all seemed depressed; and Hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.  While I was wondering at all this, Monsieur Hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  ﬁMy children, this is the last time that I shall teach you. Orders have come from Berlin to teach nothingbut German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The new teacher arrives to-morrow. This is the lastclass in French, so I beg you to be very attentive.ﬂ  Those few words overwhelmed me. Ah! the villains! that was what they had posted at the mayor™soffice.  My last class in French!  And I barely knew how to write! So I should never learn! I must stop short where I was! How angry Iwas with myself because of the time I had wasted, the lessons I had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the Saar! My books, which only a moment before I thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarryŠmy grammar, my sacred historyŠseemed to me now like old friends, from whom I should beterribly grieved to part. And it was the same about Monsieur Hamel. The thought that he was goingaway, that I should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.  Poor man! It was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine Sunday clothes; and Iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room. It seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school. It was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.  I was at that point in my reflections, when I heard my name called. It was my turn to recite. What wouldI not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip! But I got mixed up at the first words, and I stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head. I heard Monsieur Hamel speaking to me:  ﬁI will not scold you, my little Frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‚Pshaw! I have time enough. I will learn to-morrow.™ And then you see whathappens. Ah! it has been the great misfortune of our Alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow. Now those people are entitled to say to us: ‚What! you claim to be French, and you canneither speak nor write your language!™ In all this, my poor Frantz, you are not the guiltiest one. We allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.  ﬁYour parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated. They preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous. And have I nothing to reproachmyself for? Have I not often made you water my garden instead of studying? And when I wanted to gofishing for trout, have I ever hesitated to dismiss you?ﬂ  Then, passing from one thing to another, Monsieur Hamel began to talk to us about the Frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, ﬁso long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.ﬂ 1 Then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how readily I understood. Everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy. I believed, too, that I had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations. One would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.  When the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing. For that day Monsieur Hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: ﬁFrance, Alsace, France, Alsace.ﬂThey were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks. You shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was! Nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper. At one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were French. On the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and I said to myself as I listened to them:  ﬁI wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in German too!ﬂ  From time to time, when I raised my eyes from my paper. I saw Monsieur Hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse. Think of it! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was! But the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof. What a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks! Forthey were to go away the next dayŠto leave the province forever.  However, he had the courage to keep the class to the end. After the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu. Yonder, at the back of the room, oldHauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them. I could see that he too was applying himself. His voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry. Ah! I shall remember that last class.  Suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the Angelus rang. At the same moment, the bugles of thePrussians returning from drill blared under our windows. Monsieur Hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair. Never had he seemed to me so tall.  ﬁMy friends,ﬂ he said, ﬁmy friends, IŠIŠﬂ  But something suffocated him. He could not finish the sentence.  Thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  ﬁVIVE LA FRANCE!ﬂ  Then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  ﬁThat is all; go.ﬂ3. The Child SpyHIS name was Stenne, little Stenne.  He was a child of Paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell. His mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he Temple quarter. Babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingParis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew Father Stenne andadored him. They knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  ﬁHow™s your little boy?ﬂ  Father Stenne was so fond of his boy! He was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.  Unfortunately with the siege everything changed. Father Stenne™s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home. So that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the Prussians. As for littleStenne, he did not complain™ very much of that new life.  A siege! It is such an amusing thing for urchins. No school! No lessons! Vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.  The child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night. He followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little Stenne was well posted. He could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one. At other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.  With his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers™ and bakers™ shops. There, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as M. Stenne™s son. But the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the Breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege. When little Stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker™s, you were sure to find him at the game on Place du Château d™Eau. He did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money. He contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!  One especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration. When he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.  One day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little Stenne™s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  ﬁThat makes you squint, eh? Well, I will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.ﬂ  When the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the Prussians; he received thirty francs per trip. At first Stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days. Three terrible days. He did not eat,he did not sleep. At night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening. The temptation was too great. On the fourth day he returned to the Château d™Eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.  They set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, When they reached the Flanders gate it was barely light. The tall youth took Stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentryŠan honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expressionŠhesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  ﬁLet us pass, my kind monsieur. Our mother is sick, papa is dead, I am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.ﬂ  And he wept. Stenne, covered with shame, hung his head. The sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.  ﬁHurry up,ﬂ he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the Aubervilliers Road. How the tallfellow laughed!  Confusedly, as in a dream, little Stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken. Atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires. The tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts. However, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid. The sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the Soissons railroad. That time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass. Then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledFather Stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.  ﬁCome, little brats, I wouldn™t cry!ﬂ he said to the children; ﬁwe™ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first. This little fellow looks as if he was frozen!ﬂ  Alas! It was not with cold that little Stenne was tremblingŠit was with fear, with shame. In theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow™s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets. They moved closer together tomake room for the children. They gave them a little coffee. While they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.  ﬁMY boys,ﬂ said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, ﬁthere will be something up to-night. Theyhave found out the Prussians™ countersign. I believe that this time we shall capture that infernal Bourgetagain.ﬂ  There was a explosion of cheers and laughter. They danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.  When they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes. It was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.  ﬁLet™s go back, let™s not go on,ﬂ said little Stenne again and again.  The other shrugged his shoulders and kept on. Suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.  ﬁLie down!ﬂ said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.  When they were down, he whistled. Another whistled. Another whistle answered over the snow. Theycrawled on. In front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap. The tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the Prussian.  ﬁThis is my brother,ﬂ he said, pointing to his companion.  Little Stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the Prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.  On the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.  In the corner was a gardener™s house casemated with trunks of trees. The lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire. The cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters! Above were the officers. They could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne. When the Parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them. Theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk. All the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetArab™s vocabulary. They laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theParisian mud which he brought them.  Little Stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim. Opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver Prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little Stenne. Affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as Stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  ﬁI would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.ﬂ  From that moment Stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.  To escape that torture, he began to drink. Soon everything about him whirled around. He heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the National Guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the Marais, a night alarm on the ramparts. Then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious. The villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.  At that little Stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  ﬁNot that! I won™t have it!ﬂ  But the other simply laughed and kept on. Before he had finished, all the officers were standing. One ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  ﬁClear out!ﬂ  And they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in German.  The tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money. Stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the Prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  ﬁNot a nice thing to do, that. Not a nice thing.ﬂ  Tears came to his eyes.  Once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city. Their bag was full ofpotatoes which the Prussians had given them. With them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters. There they were preparing for the night attack. Troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls. The old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression. When the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.  Oh! how that smile hurt little Stenne! For a moment he was tempted to call out:  ﬁDon™t go there; we have betrayed you.ﬂ  But the other had told him: ﬁIf you speak we shall be shotﬂ; and fear restrained him.  At La Courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money. Truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little Stenne™s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.  But when he was alone, the wretched child! When the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever. Paris didnot seem the same to him. The people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.He heard the word ﬁspyﬂ in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal. Atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.  Never had Father Stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night. Newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better. As he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  ﬁI say, my boy, how you would go at the Prussians if you were big!ﬂ  Above eight o™clock, they heard cannon.  ﬁThat is Aubervilliers. They are fighting at Bourget,ﬂ said the good man, who knew all the forts. LittleStenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep. Thecannon still roared. He imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the Prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush. He remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him. The price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of Monsieur Stenne, of a soldierŠtears choked him. In theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it. Below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city. Evidently it was a real battle. The unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.  ﬁWhat™s the matter with you?ﬂ asked Father Stenne as he entered the room.  The child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father™s feet. Atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.  ﬁWhat is all this? Have you been stealing?ﬂ demanded the old man, trembling.  Thereupon, without pausing for breath, little Stenne told him that he had been to the Prussian quartersand of what he had done there.  As he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself. Father Stenne listened, with a terribleface. When it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.  ﬁFather, fatherŠﬂ the child began.  The old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.  ﬁIs this all?ﬂ he asked.  Little Stenne motioned that it was all. The old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  ﬁAll right; I am going to return it to them.ﬂ  And without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness. He was never seen again.4. The Game of BilliardsAS they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted. And yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.  Benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another. There are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour™s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep. Rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.It is funereal.  What are they doing there? What is going on? The guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something. The mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.Everything seems ready for an attack. Why do they not attack? What are they waiting for?  They are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none. And yet the headquarters are not far away. Theyare at yonder stately Louis-Treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill. Truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of France.Behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch. On the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage. Although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war. The oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.  The rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans. Everything glistens,everything is peaceful. Really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army. The horses are resting inthe stables. Here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.  The dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.In the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses. The marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.When the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.  Billiards! that is the weakness of that great warrior. He stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game. His aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful. uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes. When the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog. There is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at Compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.  The marshal™s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily. He is what is called an officer with a future.  Attention, young man, let us be on our guard! The marshal has fifteen, and you ten. The point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.  It is really an interesting game. The balls roll and clash and mingle their colours. The cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot. Suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky. A dullsound rattles the windows. Everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously. The marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.  But there comes another flash, then another. The cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste. Theaides-de-camp run to the windows. Can it be that the Prussians are attacking.  ﬁVery well, let them attack!ﬂ says the marshal, chalking his cue. ﬁIt™s your turn, captain.ﬂ  The staff quivers with admiration. Turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action. Meanwhile the uproarredoubles. With the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry. A red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns. The whole park is on fire. The terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the Arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.The headquarters begins to be excited. Despatch after despatch. Couriers arrive at full speed. They askfor the marshal.  The marshal cannot be seen. Did I not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?  ﬁIt is your turn, captain.ﬂ  But the captain is distraught. That is what it is to be young. Behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game. Thereupon the marshal becomesfurious. Surprise and indignation animate his manly face. Just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard. An aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound. ﬁMarshal, marshal!ﬂ You should see how he is greeted. Puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  ﬁWhat™s the matter? What™s all this? Isn™t there any sentry there?ﬂ  ﬁBut, marshalŠŠﬂ  ﬁAll right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in God™s name!ﬂ  And the window is violently closed.  Wait for his orders! That is just what they are doing, the poor fellows. The wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces. Whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction. Nothing to do. They are awaiting orders.However, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château. Even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of France flows noiselessly. Above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.  Seventeen! eighteen! nineteen!  They hardly have time to mark the points. The roar of the battle draws nearer. The marshal has but onemore to go. Already shells are falling in the park. Suddenly one bursts over the pond. The mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers. That is the laststroke.  Then, a profound silence. Only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock. The army is in full retreat.The marshal has won his game.5. The Bad ZouaveTHAT evening the big blacksmith, Lory of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, was not happy.  When the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day™s work. Beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.  But that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave. As his old wife looked at him, she thought.  ﬁWhat can have happened to him? Can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me? Perhaps the older of the boys is sickŠŠﬂ  But she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.  At last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  ﬁAh, what brutes, what curs!ﬂ  ﬁCome, Lory, who are you talking about?ﬂ said his wife. He shouted,  ﬁI am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their Frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the BavariansŠmore of those fellows who haveŠhow do they sayit?Š‚chosen Prussian citizenship.™ And to think that every day we seeing such false Alsatians comeback! What can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?ﬂ  The mother tried to defend them.  ﬁMy poor husband, what do you expect? Those boys are not entirely to blame. They are sent to Algeria,so far away in Africa! They get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.ﬂ  Lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.  ﬁBe still, mother! You women-folk understand nothing at all. You live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs. I tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels! If bad luck ever made our own Christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is George Lory, seven years chasseur in the army ofFrance, I would run him through the body with my saber!ﬂ  Terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur™s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in Africa.  But merely to look at that honest Alsatian face,Šburned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness aroundŠthat was enough to quiet himsuddenly. He began to laugh.  ﬁI am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way! As if our Christian could dream of turningPrussianŠChristian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!ﬂ  Brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the Ville de Strasbourg.  The old woman was now left alone. She had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep. She picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house. Once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  ﬁOf courseŠthere can be no doubt of itŠthey are scoundrels and renegadesŠbut, what of it? Theirmothers are glad to see them again.ﬂ  And she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden. She looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the Zouaves.  Suddenly she trembled. The little gate at the backŠthe gate which led to the fields,Šhad been opened.The dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.  ﬁGood-day, mother!ﬂ  His uniform all awry, there stood before her Christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued. The wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out. She wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.How long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him! And then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!Šhow he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:Šweary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the disciplineŠmuch harsher of lateŠas well as of hiscomrades, who called him ﬁPrussianﬂ because of his Alsatian accent. She believed every word he said.She had only to look at him to believe him. Deep in their talk, they went into the lower room. The littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother. He was urged to eat,but he was not hungry. He was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.  But some one was coming into the yard. It was the black-smith returning.  ﬁChristian, here comes your father. Quick, hide until I have time to talk with him and explain.ﬂ  She pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands. But as ill fortune would have it, the Zouave™s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thingLory noticed as he entered. The mother™s pallor, and her agitationŠhe understood it all.  ﬁChristian is here!ﬂ he cried, in a terrible voice. Taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the Zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.  The mother threw herself between them.  ﬁLory, Lory! Don™t kill him! He came back because I wrote that you needed him at the forge!ﬂ  She riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing. The children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.  The smith stood still and looked at his wife.  ﬁOh!ﬂ he said. ﬁSo it was you who made him come back! Very well. It is time he went to bed. I shalldecide to-morrow what I must do.ﬂ  Christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child. Already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window. Hammers wereringing on the anvil below. His mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband™s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night. Nor had the father gone to bed. Till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets. He now entered his son™s room.He was very grave and dressed for a journey. He wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule. He went straight to the bed.  ﬁCome, get up!ﬂ  Dazed, the boy made as if to get his Zouave equipment.  ﬁNo, not that!ﬂ said the father, sternly.  The mother, all apprehension, said,  ﬁBut, my dear, he has no other things.ﬂ  ﬁGive him mine. I shall not need them again.ﬂ  While the boy dressed, Lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.As soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.  ﬁNow let us go down,ﬂ he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.  The blast roared. Everyone was at work. When Christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in Algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.He felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.  At last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.  ﬁBoy,ﬂ he said, ﬁthere stands the anvil with the tools. They are all yours. And so is all this.ﬂ Heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.  ﬁThe hives, the vine, the house itself,Šthey are all yours. You sacrificed your honour for these things.The least you can do is to take care of them. Now you are master here. As for myself, I shall go away.You owe five years to France: I am going to pay them for you.ﬂ  ﬁLory, Lory!™ cried the poor old wife, ﬁwhere are you going?ﬂ  ﬁFather!ﬂ begged the son.  But the blacksmith was already on his way. He walked with great strides and did not turn back.  At Sidi-bel-Abbés, the dépôt of the Third Zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years.FootnotesNote 1.  ﬁS™il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.ﬂŠMistral.

       " 'His first notable success came in 1866 with his ﬁLettres de mon Moulin,ﬂ a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy, and this was followed up by a longer work, ﬁLe petit chose,ﬂ apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youth.',\n",
       " 'In 1872 he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing ﬁTartarin of Tarascon,ﬂ probably the most vital of all his creations.',\n",
       " 'In ﬁFromont jeune etRisler aînéﬂ he created another great character, Delobelle, the broken-down actor, and he took captive thereading world by his combination of humor and pathos, and the vividness of his portraits of types.',\n",
       " 'Pathoswas again the chief characteristic of ﬁJack,ﬂ in which the life of a neglected boy at a school which recallsthe establishment of Mr. Squeers is not the only parallel between Daudet and Dickens.',\n",

       " 'A delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionŠthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.ŠFrom ﬁPartial Portraitsﬂ (1888).Criticisms and InterpretationsII.',\n",

       " 'The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor.',\n",
       " 'He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts.',\n",
       " 'The subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments.',\n",
       " 'Only with that ﬁtrembling of the fingers,ﬂ with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen.',\n",
       " 'He at once launches into the full current of the action.',\n",
       " 'Ashis figures are already ﬁon foot in his mind,ﬂ he loses no time in introducing them in full activity.',\n",
       " 'Thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.There are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène.',\n",

       " 'Then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom Russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.',\n",

       " 'Two or three times, the terrible volleys from Porte Maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of Bazaine under the walls ofBerlin, and guns fired in his honour at the Invalides.',\n",
       " 'Another day when his bed had been moved to thewindowŠit was, I believe, the Thursday of BuzenvalŠhe saw large numbers of National Guardscollected on Avenue de la Grande Armée.',\n",

       " 'ﬁPoor Father Jouve!',\n",
       " 'He had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement.',\n",

       " 'I wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness.',\n",
       " 'This much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, Paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.',\n",

a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionŠthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.ŠFrom ﬁPartial Portraitsﬂ (1888).Criticisms and InterpretationsII.', 'By George PellissierDAUDET works in a sort of fever.', 'Even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost ﬁlivedﬂ them.', 'This habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition.', 'The original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor.', 'He first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts.', 'The subject urges him on and outstrips him;

with new millionaires in ﬁle nababﬂ; with the talkative typeof his native south in ﬁnuma roumestan,ﬂ satirizing the statesman gambetta; with the demimonde inﬁsaphoﬂ; while in ﬁl™immortelﬂ he drew a scathing picture of the french academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership.ﬁtartarinﬂ reappeared in all his buoyancy in ﬁtartarin surles alpes,ﬂ and, less successfully as a colonist in ﬁport-tarascon.ﬂ some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings.he died at paris on december 17, 1897.daudet was especially distinguished for his style.he wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity.he belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.none of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called ﬁcontes dulundiﬂ from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.the horrors of the franco-prussian war have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.ﬁthe siege of berlin,ﬂ ﬁthe last class,ﬂ and ﬁthe bad zouaveﬂ are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of french patriotism.w.a. n.criticisms and interpretationsi.by henry jamesthe charm of daudet™s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities.this, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous.to alphonse daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords.a delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionšthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.šfrom ﬁpartial portraitsﬂ (1888).criticisms and interpretationsii.by george pellissierdaudet works in a sort of fever.even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost ﬁlivedﬂ them.this habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition.the original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor.he first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts.the subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments.only with that ﬁtrembling of the fingers,ﬂ with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen.he at once launches into the full current of the action.ashis figures are already ﬁon foot in his mind,ﬂ he loses no time in introducing them in full activity.thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.there are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène.he renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibrationšwhat is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.šfrom ﬁthe literary movement in france in the nineteenthcenturyﬂ (1893).1.the siege of berlinwe were going up avenue des champs-elysées with dr. všš, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of paris, when, just before we reached therond-point de l™etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the arc de triomphe, said to me:  ﬁdo you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony?in the early days of august, thatterrible august of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, i was called there to see a case ofapoplexy.it was the apartment of colonel jouve, a cuirassier of the first empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the champs-élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war.guess why?in order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.poor old fellow!the news of wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table.when he readthe name of napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.ﬁi found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe.he must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous.handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty.beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears.she looked like him.one who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.ﬁthe child™s grief touched me.daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on macmahon™sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible.i comforted her as best i could, but in reality i had little hope.we had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it.for three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor.then the news of reichshofen reached paris.youremember in what a strange way it came.up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand prussians killed and the prince royal a prisoner.i know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when i approached his bed, i did not find the same man there.his eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy.he had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  ﬁ‚vic-to-ry!™  ﬁand as i gave him details of the grand exploit of macmahon, i saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.ﬁwhen i left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death.she was sobbing.ﬁ‚but he is saved!™ i said, taking her hands.ﬁthe unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply.the true report of reichshofen had been placarded;macmahon in retreat, the whole army crushed.we gazed at each other in consternation.she was indespair, thinking of her father.i trembled, thinking of the old man.he certainly could not stand this freshshock.and yet what were we to do?leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him?but inthat case we must lie.ﬁ‚very well, i will lie!™ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather™s chamber.ﬁit was a hard task that she had undertaken.the first few days she had no great difficulty.the goodman™s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child.but with returning health hisideas became clearer.we had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him.really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: bazainebesieging berlin, froissart in bavaria, macmahon on the baltic.for all this she asked my advice, and iassisted her as well as i could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion.he had conquered germany so many times under the first empire!he knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‚now this is where they will go.now this is what they will do™; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.ﬁunlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.that old man was insatiable!every day, when i arrived, i learned of some new military exploit.ﬁ‚doctor, we have taken mayence,™ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and i would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  ﬁ‚they are getting on!they are getting on!in a week we shall be in berlin!™  ﬁat that moment the prussians were only a week™s march from paris.we asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and i considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth.so we decided to remain.ﬁthe first day of the investment of paris, i went up to their rooms, i remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all.i found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.ﬁ‚well,™ he said, ‚so the siege has begun!™  ﬁi gazed at him in blank amazement.ﬁ‚what, colonel!you know?™  ﬁhis granddaughter turned towards me:  ﬁ‚why, yes, doctor, that™s the great news.the siege of berlin has begun.™  ﬁas she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air!how could he have suspectedanything?he could not hear the guns of the forts.he could not see our unfortunate paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold.what he saw from his bed was a section of the arc de triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the first empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion.portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the king of rome in a baby™s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of st. helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;šand all these things: consoles, king of rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806.gallant colonel!it was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of berlin.ﬁfrom that day our military operations were much simplified.to take berlin was only a matter ofpatience.from time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hissonšan imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter paris, and since sedan,macmahon™s aide-de-camp had been sent to a german fortress.you can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country.sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks.but the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep.thereupon a letter from germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears.the colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused.but where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son.‚never forget that you are a frenchman,™ hewould say to him.‚be generous to those poor people.don™t make the invasion too hard for them.™ andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors.he interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished.thereupon i must say that he was not exacting.ﬁ‚a war indemnity, and nothing more.what is the use of taking their provinces?is it possible to turngermany into france?™  ﬁhe dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.ﬁmeanwhile the siege went onšnot the siege of berlin, alas!it was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine.but, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man™s serenity was not disturbed for an instant.tothe very end i was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him.there was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfishšthe old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things.then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.ﬁ‚do you understand that, my love?we had horseflesh!™  ﬁi rather think that she did understand it.for two months she had had nothing else.from that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.that numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear.two or three times, the terrible volleys from porte maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of bazaine under the walls ofberlin, and guns fired in his honour at the invalides.another day when his bed had been moved to thewindowšit was, i believe, the thursday of buzenvalšhe saw large numbers of national guardscollected on avenue de la grande armée.ﬁ‚what are all those troops?™ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  ﬁ‚poorly set up!poorly set up!™  ﬁthat was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth.unluckily we did nottake enough.ﬁone evening when i arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.ﬁ‚they are to march into the city to-morrow,™ she said.ﬁwas the grandfather™s door open?in truth, on thinking it over afterwards, i remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night.it is probable that he had overheard us.but we were talkingof the prussians; and the good man was thinking of the french, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so longšmacmahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.ﬁpoor father jouve!he had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement.so he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from porte maillot to the tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofmilhaud™s cuirassiers.i wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness.this much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.ﬁfor a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.ﬁbut no!yonder, behind the arc de triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight.then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of jenabegan to beat, and beneath the arc de triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, schubert™s triumphal march burst forth!ﬁthereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‚to arms!to arms!theprussians!™ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall.that time, colonel jouve was really dead.ﬂ2.the last classšthe story of a little alsatiani was very late for school that morning, and i was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asmonsieur hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and i did not know the first thingabout them.for a moment i thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields.it wassuch a warm, lovely day.i could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in therippert field, behind the sawmill, the prussians going through their drill.all that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but i had the strength to resist, and i ran as fast as icould to school.as i passed the mayor™s office, i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted.for two years all our bad news had come from that boardšbattles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and i thought without stopping:  ﬁwhat can it be now?ﬂ  then, as i ran across the square, wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  ﬁdon™t hurry so, my boy; you™ll get to your school soon enough!ﬂ  i thought that he was making fun of me, and i ran into monsieur hamel™s little yard all out of breath.usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher™s stout ruler beating on the desk:  ﬁa little more quiet!ﬂ  i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a sunday morning.through the open window i saw my comrades already in their places, andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm.i had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence.you can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraid!but no!monsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  ﬁgo at once to your seat, my little frantz; we were going to begin without you.ﬂ  i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk.not until then, when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class.but whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides.they all seemed depressed; and hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.while i was wondering at all this, monsieur hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  ﬁmy children, this is the last time that i shall teach you.orders have come from berlin to teach nothingbut german in the schools of alsace and lorraine.the new teacher arrives to-morrow.this is the lastclass in french, so i beg you to be very attentive.ﬂ  those few words overwhelmed me.ah!the villains!that was what they had posted at the mayor™soffice.my last class in french!and i barely knew how to write!so i should never learn!i must stop short where i was!how angry iwas with myself because of the time i had wasted, the lessons i had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the saar!my books, which only a moment before i thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarryšmy grammar, my sacred historyšseemed to me now like old friends, from whom i should beterribly grieved to part.and it was the same about monsieur hamel.the thought that he was goingaway, that i should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.poor man!it was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes; and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room.it seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school.it was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.i was at that point in my reflections, when i heard my name called.it was my turn to recite.what wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip!but i got mixed up at the first words, and i stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head.i heard monsieur hamel speaking to me:  ﬁi will not scold you, my little frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‚pshaw!i have time enough.i will learn to-morrow.™ and then you see whathappens.ah!it has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow.now those people are entitled to say to us: ‚what!you claim to be french, and you canneither speak nor write your language!™ in all this, my poor frantz, you are not the guiltiest one.we allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.ﬁyour parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated.they preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous.and have i nothing to reproachmyself for?have i not often made you water my garden instead of studying?and when i wanted to gofishing for trout, have i ever hesitated to dismiss you?ﬂ  then, passing from one thing to another, monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, ﬁso long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.ﬂ 1 then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson.i was amazed to see how readily i understood.everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy.i believed, too, that i had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations.one would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.when the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing.for that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: ﬁfrance, alsace, france, alsace.ﬂthey were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks.you shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was!nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper.at one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were french.on the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and i said to myself as i listened to them:  ﬁi wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in german too!ﬂ  from time to time, when i raised my eyes from my paper.i saw monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse.think of it!for forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was!but the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof.what a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks!forthey were to go away the next dayšto leave the province forever.however, he had the courage to keep the class to the end.after the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu.yonder, at the back of the room, oldhauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them.i could see that he too was applying himself.his voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry.ah!i shall remember that last class.suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the angelus rang.at the same moment, the bugles of theprussians returning from drill blared under our windows.monsieur hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair.never had he seemed to me so tall.ﬁmy friends,ﬂ he said, ﬁmy friends, išišﬂ  but something suffocated him.he could not finish the sentence.thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  ﬁvive la france!ﬂ  then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  ﬁthat is all; go.ﬂ3.the child spyhis name was stenne, little stenne.he was a child of paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell.his mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he temple quarter.babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingparis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew father stenne andadored him.they knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  ﬁhow™s your little boy?ﬂ  father stenne was so fond of his boy!he was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.unfortunately with the siege everything changed.father stenne™s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home.so that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the prussians.as for littlestenne, he did not complain™ very much of that new life.a siege!it is such an amusing thing for urchins.no school!no lessons!vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.the child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night.he followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little stenne was well posted.he could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one.at other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.with his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers™ and bakers™ shops.there, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as m. stenne™s son.but the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege.when little stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker™s, you were sure to find him at the game on place du château d™eau.he did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money.he contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!one especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration.when he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.one day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little stenne™s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  ﬁthat makes you squint, eh?well, i will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.ﬂ  when the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the prussians; he received thirty francs per trip.at first stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days.three terrible days.he did not eat,he did not sleep.at night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening.the temptation was too great.on the fourth day he returned to the château d™eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.they set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, when they reached the flanders gate it was barely light.the tall youth took stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentryšan honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expressionšhesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  ﬁlet us pass, my kind monsieur.our mother is sick, papa is dead, i am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.ﬂ  and he wept.stenne, covered with shame, hung his head.the sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.ﬁhurry up,ﬂ he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the aubervilliers road.how the tallfellow laughed!confusedly, as in a dream, little stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken.atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires.the tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts.however, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid.the sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the soissons railroad.that time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass.then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledfather stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.ﬁcome, little brats, i wouldn™t cry!ﬂ he said to the children; ﬁwe™ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first.this little fellow looks as if he was frozen!ﬂ  alas!it was not with cold that little stenne was tremblingšit was with fear, with shame.in theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow™s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets.they moved closer together tomake room for the children.they gave them a little coffee.while they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.ﬁmy boys,ﬂ said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, ﬁthere will be something up to-night.theyhave found out the prussians™ countersign.i believe that this time we shall capture that infernal bourgetagain.ﬂ  there was a explosion of cheers and laughter.they danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.when they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes.it was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.ﬁlet™s go back, let™s not go on,ﬂ said little stenne again and again.the other shrugged his shoulders and kept on.suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.ﬁlie down!ﬂ said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.when they were down, he whistled.another whistled.another whistle answered over the snow.theycrawled on.in front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap.the tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the prussian.ﬁthis is my brother,ﬂ he said, pointing to his companion.little stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.on the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.in the corner was a gardener™s house casemated with trunks of trees.the lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire.the cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters!above were the officers.they could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne.when the parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them.theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk.all the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetarab™s vocabulary.they laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theparisian mud which he brought them.little stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim.opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little stenne.affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  ﬁi would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.ﬂ  from that moment stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.to escape that torture, he began to drink.soon everything about him whirled around.he heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the national guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the marais, a night alarm on the ramparts.then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious.the villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.at that little stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  ﬁnot that!i won™t have it!ﬂ  but the other simply laughed and kept on.before he had finished, all the officers were standing.one ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  ﬁclear out!ﬂ  and they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in german.the tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money.stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  ﬁnot a nice thing to do, that.not a nice thing.ﬂ  tears came to his eyes.once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city.their bag was full ofpotatoes which the prussians had given them.with them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters.there they were preparing for the night attack.troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls.the old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression.when the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.oh!how that smile hurt little stenne!for a moment he was tempted to call out:  ﬁdon™t go there; we have betrayed you.ﬂ  but the other had told him: ﬁif you speak we shall be shotﬂ; and fear restrained him.at la courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money.truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little stenne™s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.but when he was alone, the wretched child!when the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever.paris didnot seem the same to him.the people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.he heard the word ﬁspyﬂ in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal.atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.never had father stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night.newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better.as he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  ﬁi say, my boy, how you would go at the prussians if you were big!ﬂ  above eight o™clock, they heard cannon.ﬁthat is aubervilliers.they are fighting at bourget,ﬂ said the good man, who knew all the forts.littlestenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep.thecannon still roared.he imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush.he remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him.the price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of monsieur stenne, of a soldierštears choked him.in theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it.below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city.evidently it was a real battle.the unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.ﬁwhat™s the matter with you?ﬂ asked father stenne as he entered the room.the child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father™s feet.atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.ﬁwhat is all this?have you been stealing?ﬂ demanded the old man, trembling.thereupon, without pausing for breath, little stenne told him that he had been to the prussian quartersand of what he had done there.as he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself.father stenne listened, with a terribleface.when it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.ﬁfather, fatheršﬂ the child began.the old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.ﬁis this all?ﬂ he asked.little stenne motioned that it was all.the old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  ﬁall right; i am going to return it to them.ﬂ  and without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness.he was never seen again.4.the game of billiardsas they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted.and yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another.there are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour™s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep.rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.it is funereal.what are they doing there?what is going on?the guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something.the mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.everything seems ready for an attack.why do they not attack?what are they waiting for?they are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none.and yet the headquarters are not far away.theyare at yonder stately louis-treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill.truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of france.behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch.on the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage.although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war.the oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.the rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans.everything glistens,everything is peaceful.really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army.the horses are resting inthe stables.here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.the dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.in the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses.the marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.when the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.billiards!that is the weakness of that great warrior.he stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game.his aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful.uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes.when the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog.there is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.the marshal™s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily.he is what is called an officer with a future.attention, young man, let us be on our guard!the marshal has fifteen, and you ten.the point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.it is really an interesting game.the balls roll and clash and mingle their colours.the cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot.suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky.a dullsound rattles the windows.everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously.the marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.but there comes another flash, then another.the cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste.theaides-de-camp run to the windows.can it be that the prussians are attacking.ﬁvery well, let them attack!ﬂ says the marshal, chalking his cue.ﬁit™s your turn, captain.ﬂ  the staff quivers with admiration.turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action.meanwhile the uproarredoubles.with the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry.a red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns.the whole park is on fire.the terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.the headquarters begins to be excited.despatch after despatch.couriers arrive at full speed.they askfor the marshal.the marshal cannot be seen.did i not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?ﬁit is your turn, captain.ﬂ  but the captain is distraught.that is what it is to be young.behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game.thereupon the marshal becomesfurious.surprise and indignation animate his manly face.just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard.an aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound.ﬁmarshal, marshal!ﬂ you should see how he is greeted.puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  ﬁwhat™s the matter?what™s all this?isn™t there any sentry there?ﬂ  ﬁbut, marshalššﬂ  ﬁall right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in god™s name!ﬂ  and the window is violently closed.wait for his orders!that is just what they are doing, the poor fellows.the wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces.whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction.nothing to do.they are awaiting orders.however, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château.even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of france flows noiselessly.above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.seventeen!eighteen!nineteen!they hardly have time to mark the points.the roar of the battle draws nearer.the marshal has but onemore to go.already shells are falling in the park.suddenly one bursts over the pond.the mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers.that is the laststroke.then, a profound silence.only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock.the army is in full retreat.the marshal has won his game.5.the bad zouavethat evening the big blacksmith, lory of sainte-marie-aux-mines, was not happy.when the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day™s work.beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.but that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave.as his old wife looked at him, she thought.ﬁwhat can have happened to him?can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me?perhaps the older of the boys is sickššﬂ  but she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.at last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  ﬁah, what brutes, what curs!ﬂ  ﬁcome, lory, who are you talking about?ﬂ said his wife.he shouted,  ﬁi am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the bavariansšmore of those fellows who havešhow do they sayit?š‚chosen prussian citizenship.™ and to think that every day we seeing such false alsatians comeback!what can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?ﬂ  the mother tried to defend them.ﬁmy poor husband, what do you expect?those boys are not entirely to blame.they are sent to algeria,so far away in africa!they get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.ﬂ  lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.ﬁbe still, mother!you women-folk understand nothing at all.you live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs.i tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels!if bad luck ever made our own christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is george lory, seven years chasseur in the army offrance, i would run him through the body with my saber!ﬂ  terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur™s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in africa.but merely to look at that honest alsatian face,šburned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness aroundšthat was enough to quiet himsuddenly.he began to laugh.ﬁi am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way!as if our christian could dream of turningprussianšchristian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!ﬂ  brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the ville de strasbourg.the old woman was now left alone.she had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep.she picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house.once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  ﬁof coursešthere can be no doubt of itšthey are scoundrels and renegadesšbut, what of it?theirmothers are glad to see them again.ﬂ  and she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden.she looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the zouaves.suddenly she trembled.the little gate at the backšthe gate which led to the fields,šhad been opened.the dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.ﬁgood-day, mother!ﬂ  his uniform all awry, there stood before her christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued.the wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out.she wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.how long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him!and then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!šhow he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:šweary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the disciplinešmuch harsher of latešas well as of hiscomrades, who called him ﬁprussianﬂ because of his alsatian accent.she believed every word he said.she had only to look at him to believe him.deep in their talk, they went into the lower room.the littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother.he was urged to eat,but he was not hungry.he was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.but some one was coming into the yard.it was the black-smith returning.ﬁchristian, here comes your father.quick, hide until i have time to talk with him and explain.ﬂ  she pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands.but as ill fortune would have it, the zouave™s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thinglory noticed as he entered.the mother™s pallor, and her agitationšhe understood it all.ﬁchristian is here!ﬂ he cried, in a terrible voice.taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.the mother threw herself between them.ﬁlory, lory!don™t kill him!he came back because i wrote that you needed him at the forge!ﬂ  she riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing.the children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.the smith stood still and looked at his wife.ﬁoh!ﬂ he said.ﬁso it was you who made him come back!very well.it is time he went to bed.i shalldecide to-morrow what i must do.ﬂ  christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child.already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window.hammers wereringing on the anvil below.his mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband™s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night.nor had the father gone to bed.till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets.he now entered his son™s room.he was very grave and dressed for a journey.he wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule.he went straight to the bed.ﬁcome, get up!ﬂ  dazed, the boy made as if to get his zouave equipment.ﬁno, not that!ﬂ said the father, sternly.the mother, all apprehension, said,  ﬁbut, my dear, he has no other things.ﬂ  ﬁgive him mine.i shall not need them again.ﬂ  while the boy dressed, lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.as soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.ﬁnow let us go down,ﬂ he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.the blast roared.everyone was at work.when christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.he felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.at last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.ﬁboy,ﬂ he said, ﬁthere stands the anvil with the tools.they are all yours.and so is all this.ﬂ heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.ﬁthe hives, the vine, the house itself,šthey are all yours.you sacrificed your honour for these things.the least you can do is to take care of them.now you are master here.as for myself, i shall go away.you owe five years to france: i am going to pay them for you.ﬂ  ﬁlory, lory!™ cried the poor old wife, ﬁwhere are you going?ﬂ  ﬁfather!ﬂ begged the son.but the blacksmith was already on his way.he walked with great strides and did not turn back.at sidi-bel-abbés, the dépôt of the third zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years.footnotesnote 1.  ﬁs™il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.ﬂšmistral.[back]bibliographic recordauthor: daudet, alphonse, 1840œ1897.title: five short stories, by alphonse daudet.series: the harvard classics shelf of fiction, selected by charles w. eliot, with notes and introductionsby william allan neilson.published: new york: p.f.collier & son, 1917.physical details: vol.13, part 4, of 20;

with new millionaires in ﬁle nababﬂ; with the talkative typeof his native south in ﬁnuma roumestan,ﬂ satirizing the statesman gambetta; with the demimonde inﬁsaphoﬂ; while in ﬁl™immortelﬂ he drew a scathing picture of the french academy, which neverhonored itself by electing him to membership.ﬁtartarinﬂ reappeared in all his buoyancy in ﬁtartarin surles alpes,ﬂ and, less successfully as a colonist in ﬁport-tarascon.ﬂ some volumes of reminiscences, aconsiderable number of short stories, some delightful tales for children, and a few plays complete the listof his more important writings.he died at paris on december 17, 1897.daudet was especially distinguished for his style.he wrote with a great impression of ease, yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicity.he belonged to the realistic school, and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleagues.none of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories, and the collection called ﬁcontes dulundiﬂ from which the following examples are taken exhibit his power of restrained pathos at its height.the horrors of the franco-prussian war have been more terribly pictured on some larger canvases, butno one has etched with more delicacy and sensitiveness the small private tragedies of that great disaster.ﬁthe siege of berlin,ﬂ ﬁthe last class,ﬂ and ﬁthe bad zouaveﬂ are not only classics of the art of theshort story; they contain the essence of french patriotism.w.a. n.criticisms and interpretationsi.by henry jamesthe charm of daudet™s talent comes from its being charged to an extraordinary degree with histemperament, his feelings, his instincts, his natural qualities.this, of course, is a charm in a style onlywhen nature has been generous.to alphonse daudet she has been exceptionally so; she has placed in hishand an instrument of many chords.a delicate nervous organisation, active and indefatigable in spite ofits delicacy, and familiar with emotion of almost every kind, equally acquainted with pleasure and withpain; a light, quick, joyous, yet reflective, imagination, a faculty of seeing images, making images, atevery turn, of conceiving everything in the visible form, in the plastic spirit; an extraordinary sensibilityto all the impressions of life and a faculty of language which is in perfect harmony with his wonderfulfineness of perceptionšthese are some of the qualities of which he is the happy possessor, and whichmake his equipment for the work he has undertaken exceedingly rich.šfrom ﬁpartial portraitsﬂ (1888).criticisms and interpretationsii.by george pellissierdaudet works in a sort of fever.even before beginning to write his books, he has related, acted, andalmost ﬁlivedﬂ them.this habit responds to a necessity of his nature, and this he also constitutes hisprocess of composition.the original sketch is only an improvisation, but with the second version beginswhat he calls the painful part of his labor.he first abandons himself to his fancy, giving free rein to histroubadour instincts.the subject urges him on and outstrips him; his hand glides rapidly over the paperwithout writing all the words, or even pausing to punctuate, in the effort to follow the fever of his toilingbrain by hastily stenographing ideas and sentiments.only with that ﬁtrembling of the fingers,ﬂ with hima sign of inspiration, does he take up his pen.he at once launches into the full current of the action.ashis figures are already ﬁon foot in his mind,ﬂ he loses no time in introducing them in full activity.thegreater part of his novels consists in a series of pictures or episodes which pass in file beneath our eyes.there are no preludes either at the outset or in passing from one chapter to another; he explains thesituation by a word, leaving the reader to imagine such events as are not adapted to an entirely actualmise en scène.he renders only what moves his heart and sets his nerves in vibrationšwhat is dramatic,picturesque, and animated in human affairs.šfrom ﬁthe literary movement in france in the nineteenthcenturyﬂ (1893).1.the siege of berlinwe were going up avenue des champs-elysées with dr. všš, asking the shell-riddled walls, and thesidewalks torn up by grape-shot, for the story of the siege of paris, when, just before we reached therond-point de l™etoile, the doctor stopped and, pointing to one of the great corner houses so proudlygrouped about the arc de triomphe, said to me:  ﬁdo you see those four closed windows up there on that balcony?in the early days of august, thatterrible august of last year, so heavily laden with storms and disasters, i was called there to see a case ofapoplexy.it was the apartment of colonel jouve, a cuirassier of the first empire, an old enthusiast on thesubject of glory and patriotism, who had come to live on the champs-élysées, in an apartment with abalcony, at the outbreak of the war.guess why?in order to witness the triumphant return of our troops.poor old fellow!the news of wissembourg reached him just as he was leaving the table.when he readthe name of napoleon at the foot of that bulletin of defeat, he fell like a log.ﬁi found the former cuirassier stretched out at full length on the carpet, his face covered with blood, andas lifeless as if he had received a blow on the head from a poleaxe.he must have been very tall when hewas standing; lying there, he looked enormous.handsome features, magnificent teeth, a fleece of curlywhite hair, eighty years with the appearance of sixty.beside him was his granddaughter, on her kneesand bathed in tears.she looked like him.one who saw them side by side might have taken them for twobeautiful greek medallions, struck from the same die, one of which was old and earth-coloured, a littleroughened on the edges, the other resplendent and clean-cut, in all the brilliancy and smoothness of afresh impression.ﬁthe child™s grief touched me.daughter and granddaughter of soldiers, her father was on macmahon™sstaff, and the image of that tall old man stretched out before her evoked in her mind another image noless terrible.i comforted her as best i could, but in reality i had little hope.we had to do with a case ofcomplete paralysis on one side, and at eighty years of age few people recover from it.for three days thepatient lay in the same state of inanition and stupor.then the news of reichshofen reached paris.youremember in what a strange way it came.up to the evening, we all believed in a great victory, twentythousand prussians killed and the prince royal a prisoner.i know not by what miracle, what magneticcurrent, an echo of that national rejoicing sought out our poor deaf-mute in the depths of his paralysis;but the fact is that on that evening, when i approached his bed, i did not find the same man there.his eyewas almost clear, his tongue less heavy.he had the strength to smile at me, and he stammered twice:  ﬁ‚vic-to-ry!™  ﬁand as i gave him details of the grand exploit of macmahon, i saw that his features relaxed and hisface lighted up.ﬁwhen i left the room, the girl was waiting for me at the door, pale as death.she was sobbing.ﬁ‚but he is saved!™ i said, taking her hands.ﬁthe unhappy child hardly had the courage to reply.the true report of reichshofen had been placarded;macmahon in retreat, the whole army crushed.we gazed at each other in consternation.she was indespair, thinking of her father.i trembled, thinking of the old man.he certainly could not stand this freshshock.and yet what were we to do?leave him his joy, and the illusions which had revived him?but inthat case we must lie.ﬁ‚very well, i will lie!™ said the heroic girl, quickly wiping away her tears; and with radiant face sheentered her grandfather™s chamber.ﬁit was a hard task that she had undertaken.the first few days she had no great difficulty.the goodman™s brain was feeble, and he allowed himself to be deceived like a child.but with returning health hisideas became clearer.we had to keep him posted concerning the movement of the armies, to draw upmilitary bulletins for him.really, it was pitiful to see that lovely child leaning night and day over hermap of germany, pinning little flags upon it, and struggling to lay out a glorious campaign: bazainebesieging berlin, froissart in bavaria, macmahon on the baltic.for all this she asked my advice, and iassisted her as well as i could; but it was the grandfather who was especially useful to us in thatimaginary invasion.he had conquered germany so many times under the first empire!he knew all thestrokes beforehand: ‚now this is where they will go.now this is what they will do™; and his anticipationswere always realised, which did not fail to make him very proud.ﬁunlucky it was of no avail for us to take cities and win battles; we never went quickly enough for him.that old man was insatiable!every day, when i arrived, i learned of some new military exploit.ﬁ‚doctor, we have taken mayence,™ the girl would say to me, coming to meet me with a heart-brokensmile, and i would hear through the door a joyous voice shouting to me:  ﬁ‚they are getting on!they are getting on!in a week we shall be in berlin!™  ﬁat that moment the prussians were only a week™s march from paris.we asked ourselves at first if itwould be better to take him into the provinces; but as soon as we were outside the city, the state of thecountry would have told him everything, and i considered him still too weak, too much benumbed by hisgreat shock, to let him know the truth.so we decided to remain.ﬁthe first day of the investment of paris, i went up to their rooms, i remember, deeply moved, with thatagony at the heart which the closed gates, the fighting under the walls, and our suburbs turned intofrontiers, gave us all.i found the good man seated on his bed, proud and jubilant.ﬁ‚well,™ he said, ‚so the siege has begun!™  ﬁi gazed at him in blank amazement.ﬁ‚what, colonel!you know?™  ﬁhis granddaughter turned towards me:  ﬁ‚why, yes, doctor, that™s the great news.the siege of berlin has begun.™  ﬁas she said this, she plied her needle with such a sedate and placid air!how could he have suspectedanything?he could not hear the guns of the forts.he could not see our unfortunate paris, all in confusionand dreadful to behold.what he saw from his bed was a section of the arc de triomphe, and in his room,about him, a collection of bric-a-brac of the first empire, well adapted to maintain his illusion.portraitsof marshals, engravings of battles, the king of rome in a baby™s dress, tall consoles adorned with coppertrophies, laden with imperial relics, medals, bronzes, a miniature of st. helena, under a globe, picturesrepresenting the same lady all becurled, in a ball-dress of yellow, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and brighteyes;šand all these things: consoles, king of rome, marshals, yellow ladies, with the high-necked,short-waisted dresses, the bestarched stiffness, which was the charm of 1806.gallant colonel!it was thatatmosphere of victories and conquests, even more than anything we could say to him, that made himbelieve so innocently in the siege of berlin.ﬁfrom that day our military operations were much simplified.to take berlin was only a matter ofpatience.from time to time, when the old man was too much bored, we would read him a letter from hissonšan imaginary letter, of course, for nothing was allowed to enter paris, and since sedan,macmahon™s aide-de-camp had been sent to a german fortress.you can imagine the despair of that poorchild, without news from her father, knowing that he was a prisoner, in need of everything, perhaps sick,and she obliged to represent him as writing joyful letters, a little short, perhaps, but such as a soldier onthe field might be expected to write, always marching forward through a conquered country.sometimesher strength gave way; then they were without news for weeks.but the old man became anxious, couldnot sleep.thereupon a letter from germany would speedily arrive, which she would bring to his bedsideand read joyously, forcing back her tears.the colonel would listen religiously, smile with a knowing air,approve, criticise, and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confused.but where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son.‚never forget that you are a frenchman,™ hewould say to him.‚be generous to those poor people.don™t make the invasion too hard for them.™ andthere were recommendations without end, admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties, thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies, a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerors.he interspersed also some general considerations upon politics, the conditions of peace to beimposed upon the vanquished.thereupon i must say that he was not exacting.ﬁ‚a war indemnity, and nothing more.what is the use of taking their provinces?is it possible to turngermany into france?™  ﬁhe dictated this in a firm voice; and one was conscious of such candour in his words, of such a noble,patriotic faith, that it was impossible not to be moved while listening to him.ﬁmeanwhile the siege went onšnot the siege of berlin, alas!it was the time of intense cold, of thebombardment, of epidemics and of famine.but, thanks to our care, to our efforts, to the unwearyingaffection which multiplied itself about him, the old man™s serenity was not disturbed for an instant.tothe very end i was able to obtain white bread and fresh meat for him.there was none for anybody buthim, to be sure; and you can imagine nothing more touching than those breakfasts of the grandfather, soinnocently selfishšthe old man seated on his bed, fresh and smiling, with a napkin at his chin, and hisgranddaughter beside him, a little pale because of privations, guiding his hand, helping him to drink, andto eat all those forbidden good things.then, enlivened by the repast, in the comfort of his warm room,the winter wind whistling outside and the snow eddying about his windows, the ex-cuirassier wouldrecall his campaigns in the north and would describe to us for the hundredth time that terrible retreatfrom russia, when they had nothing to eat but frozen biscuit and horseflesh.ﬁ‚do you understand that, my love?we had horseflesh!™  ﬁi rather think that she did understand it.for two months she had had nothing else.from that day,however, as the period of convalescence drew near, our task about the patient became more difficult.that numbness of all his senses, of all his members, which had served us so well hitherto, began todisappear.two or three times, the terrible volleys from porte maillot had made him jump, with his earspricked up like a hunting-dog; we were obliged to invent a final victory of bazaine under the walls ofberlin, and guns fired in his honour at the invalides.another day when his bed had been moved to thewindowšit was, i believe, the thursday of buzenvalšhe saw large numbers of national guardscollected on avenue de la grande armée.ﬁ‚what are all those troops?™ asked the good man; and we heard him mutter between his teeth:  ﬁ‚poorly set up!poorly set up!™  ﬁthat was all; but we understood that we must take great precautions thenceforth.unluckily we did nottake enough.ﬁone evening when i arrived, the girl came to me in great trouble.ﬁ‚they are to march into the city to-morrow,™ she said.ﬁwas the grandfather™s door open?in truth, on thinking it over afterwards, i remembered that his facewore an extraordinary expression that night.it is probable that he had overheard us.but we were talkingof the prussians; and the good man was thinking of the french, of that triumphal entry which he had beenawaiting so longšmacmahon marching down the avenue amid flowers and flourishes of trumpets, hisson beside him, and he, the old colonel, on his balcony, in full uniform as at lutzen, saluting the tornflags and the eagles blackened by powder.ﬁpoor father jouve!he had imagined doubtless that we intended to prevent him from witnessing thatparade of our troops, in order to avoid too great excitement.so he was very careful not to mention it toany one; but the next day, at the very hour when the prussian battalions entered hesitatingly upon thelong road which leads from porte maillot to the tuileries, the window up there opened softly, and thecolonel appeared on the balcony, with his helmet, his long sword, all the glorious old array of one ofmilhaud™s cuirassiers.i wonder still what effort of the will, what sudden outburst of life had placed himthus upon his feet and in his harness.this much is sure, that he was there, standing behind the rail,amazed to find the broad avenues so silent, the blinds of the houses closed, paris as gloomy as a hugelazaretto, flags everywhere, but such strange flags, white with little crosses, and no one to go to meet oursoldiers.ﬁfor a moment he might have thought that he was mistaken.ﬁbut no!yonder, behind the arc de triomphe, there was a confused rumbling, a black line approachingin the rising sunlight.then, little by little, the points of the helmets gleamed, the little drums of jenabegan to beat, and beneath the arc de triomphe, while the heavy tramp of the regiments and the clashingof the sabres beat time, schubert™s triumphal march burst forth!ﬁthereupon in the deathlike silence of the square, a cry rang out, a terrible cry: ‚to arms!to arms!theprussians!™ and the four uhlans of the vanguard saw up yonder, on the balcony, a tall old man wave hisarms, stagger, and fall.that time, colonel jouve was really dead.ﬂ2.the last classšthe story of a little alsatiani was very late for school that morning, and i was terribly afraid of being scolded, especially asmonsieur hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles, and i did not know the first thingabout them.for a moment i thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fields.it wassuch a warm, lovely day.i could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood, and in therippert field, behind the sawmill, the prussians going through their drill.all that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles; but i had the strength to resist, and i ran as fast as icould to school.as i passed the mayor™s office, i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were posted.for two years all our bad news had come from that boardšbattles lost,conscriptions, orders from headquarters; and i thought without stopping:  ﬁwhat can it be now?ﬂ  then, as i ran across the square, wachter the blacksmith, who stood there with his apprentice, readingthe placard, called out to me:  ﬁdon™t hurry so, my boy; you™ll get to your school soon enough!ﬂ  i thought that he was making fun of me, and i ran into monsieur hamel™s little yard all out of breath.usually, at the beginning of school, there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street, desksopening and closing, lessons repeated aloud in unison, with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker, andthe teacher™s stout ruler beating on the desk:  ﬁa little more quiet!ﬂ  i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed; but as it happened, that day everything wasquiet, like a sunday morning.through the open window i saw my comrades already in their places, andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his arm.i had no open the doorand enter, in the midst of that perfect silence.you can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraid!but no!monsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently:  ﬁgo at once to your seat, my little frantz; we were going to begin without you.ﬂ  i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desk.not until then, when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright, did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat, his plaited ruff, and the blacksilk embroidered breeches, which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizes.moreover, there was something extraordinary, something solemn about the whole class.but whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room, on the benches which were usually empty, somepeople from the village sitting, as silent as we were: old hauser with his three-cornered hat, theex-mayor, the ex-postman, and others besides.they all seemed depressed; and hauser had brought anold spelling-book with gnawed edges, which he held wide-open on his knee, with his great spectaclesaskew.while i was wondering at all this, monsieur hamel had mounted his platform, and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me, he said to us:  ﬁmy children, this is the last time that i shall teach you.orders have come from berlin to teach nothingbut german in the schools of alsace and lorraine.the new teacher arrives to-morrow.this is the lastclass in french, so i beg you to be very attentive.ﬂ  those few words overwhelmed me.ah!the villains!that was what they had posted at the mayor™soffice.my last class in french!and i barely knew how to write!so i should never learn!i must stop short where i was!how angry iwas with myself because of the time i had wasted, the lessons i had missed, running about after nests, orsliding on the saar!my books, which only a moment before i thought so tiresome, so heavy tocarryšmy grammar, my sacred historyšseemed to me now like old friends, from whom i should beterribly grieved to part.and it was the same about monsieur hamel.the thought that he was goingaway, that i should never see him again, made me forget the punishments, the blows with the ruler.poor man!it was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes; and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the room.it seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the school.it was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service, and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishing.i was at that point in my reflections, when i heard my name called.it was my turn to recite.what wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles, in a loud,distinct voice, without a slip!but i got mixed up at the first words, and i stood there swaying against mybench, with a full heart, afraid to raise my head.i heard monsieur hamel speaking to me:  ﬁi will not scold you, my little frantz; you must be punished enough; that is the way it goes; every daywe say to ourselves: ‚pshaw!i have time enough.i will learn to-morrow.™ and then you see whathappens.ah!it has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untilto-morrow.now those people are entitled to say to us: ‚what!you claim to be french, and you canneither speak nor write your language!™ in all this, my poor frantz, you are not the guiltiest one.we allhave our fair share of reproaches to address to ourselves.ﬁyour parents have not been careful enough to see that you were educated.they preferred to send youto work in the fields or in the factories, in order to have a few more sous.and have i nothing to reproachmyself for?have i not often made you water my garden instead of studying?and when i wanted to gofishing for trout, have i ever hesitated to dismiss you?ﬂ  then, passing from one thing to another, monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world, the most clear, the mostsubstantial; that we must always retain it among ourselves, and never forget it, because when a peoplefalls into servitude, ﬁso long as it clings to its language, it is as if it held the key to its prison.ﬂ 1 then hetook the grammer and read us our lesson.i was amazed to see how readily i understood.everything thathe said seemed so easy to me, so easy.i believed, too, that i had never listened so closely, and that he, forhis part, had never been so patient with his explanations.one would have said that, before going away,the poor man desired to give us all his knowledge, to force it all into our heads at a single blow.when the lesson was at an end, we passed to writing.for that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples, on which was written in a fine, round hand: ﬁfrance, alsace, france, alsace.ﬂthey were like little flags, waving all about the class, hanging from the rods of our desks.you shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it was!nothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paper.at one time some cock-chafers flew in; but no one paid any attention to them, noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines, with a will and conscientiousapplication, as if even the lines were french.on the roof of the schoolhouse, pigeons cooed in low tones,and i said to myself as i listened to them:  ﬁi wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in german too!ﬂ  from time to time, when i raised my eyes from my paper.i saw monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhouse.think of it!for forty years he had been there in the same place, with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it was!but the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use; thewalnuts in the yard had grown, and the hop-vine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roof.what a heart-rending thing it must have been for that poor man to leave allthose things, and to hear his sister walking back and forth in the room overhead, packing their trunks!forthey were to go away the next dayšto leave the province forever.however, he had the courage to keep the class to the end.after the writing, we had the lesson inhistory; then the little ones sang all together the ba, be, bi, bo, bu.yonder, at the back of the room, oldhauser had put on his spectacles, and, holding his spelling-book in both hands, he spelled out the letterswith them.i could see that he too was applying himself.his voice shook with emotion, and it was sofunny to hear him, that we all longed to laugh and to cry.ah!i shall remember that last class.suddenly the church clock struck twelve, then the angelus rang.at the same moment, the bugles of theprussians returning from drill blared under our windows.monsieur hamel rose, pale as death, from hischair.never had he seemed to me so tall.ﬁmy friends,ﬂ he said, ﬁmy friends, išišﬂ  but something suffocated him.he could not finish the sentence.thereupon he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, hewrote in the largest letters he could:  ﬁvive la france!ﬂ  then he stood there, with his head resting against the wall, and without speaking, he motioned to uswith his hand:  ﬁthat is all; go.ﬂ3.the child spyhis name was stenne, little stenne.he was a child of paris, sickly and pale, who might have been ten years old, perhaps fifteen; with thoseurchins one can never tell.his mother was dead; his father, formerly in the navy, was keeper of a squarein he temple quarter.babies, nurse-maids, old ladies in reclining-chairs, poor mothers, all of toddlingparis that seeks shelter from vehicles in those flower-gardens bordered by paths, knew father stenne andadored him.they knew that beneath that rough mustache, the terror of dogs and of loiterers, layconcealed a kind, melting, almost maternal smile, and that, in order to see that smile one had only to askthe good man:  ﬁhow™s your little boy?ﬂ  father stenne was so fond of his boy!he was so happy in the afternoon, after school, when the littlefellow came for him and they made together the circuit of the paths, stopping at each bench to salute theoccupants and to answer their kind words.unfortunately with the siege everything changed.father stenne™s square was closed, petroleum wasstored there, and the poor man, forced to keep watch all the time, passed his life among the deserted andneglected shrubs, alone, unable to smoke, and without the company of his boy except very late at night,at home.so that you should have seen his mustache when he mentioned the prussians.as for littlestenne, he did not complain™ very much of that new life.a siege!it is such an amusing thing for urchins.no school!no lessons!vacation all the time and thestreet like a fair.the child stayed out of doors, wandering about until night.he followed the battalions of the quarterwhen they went to the fortifications, choosing by preference those which had a good band; and upon thatsubject little stenne was well posted.he could tell you that the band of the 96th did not amount to much,but that in the 55th they had a fine one.at other times he watched the troops go through the drill; thenthere were the lines at the shopdoors.with his basket on his arm, he stood in the long lines that formed in the dark winter mornings, withoutgas, at the doors of the butchers™ and bakers™ shops.there, with their feet in the water, people becameacquainted, talked politics, and every one asked his advice, as m. stenne™s son.but the games ofbouchon were the most amusing thing of all, and that famous game of galoche, which the breton militiahad brought into fashion during the siege.when little stenne was not at the fortifications, or at thebaker™s, you were sure to find him at the game on place du château d™eau.he did not play, youunderstand; it required too much money.he contented himself with watching the players, with sucheyes!one especially, a tall youth in a blue blouse, who bet nothing less than five-franc pieces, aroused hisadmiration.when he ran you could hear the money jingling in his pockets.one day, as he picked up a coin which had rolled to little stenne™s feet, the tall youth said to him in anundertone:  ﬁthat makes you squint, eh?well, i will tell you where they are to be found, if you want.ﬂ  when the game was ended he led him to a corner of the square and proposed to him to go with him tosell newspapers to the prussians; he received thirty francs per trip.at first stenne refused, highlyindignant; and he actually stayed away from the game for three days.three terrible days.he did not eat,he did not sleep.at night, he saw piles of galoches at the foot of his bed, and five-franc pieces lying flat,all glistening.the temptation was too great.on the fourth day he returned to the château d™eau, saw thetall youth again, and allowed himself to be persuaded.they set out one snowy morning, a canvas bag over their shoulders and newspapers hidden under theirblouses, when they reached the flanders gate it was barely light.the tall youth took stenne by the hand,and, approaching the sentryšan honest volunteer with a red nose and a good-natured expressionšhesaid to him in the whining voice of a pauper:  ﬁlet us pass, my kind monsieur.our mother is sick, papa is dead, i am going out with my little brotherto pick up potatoes in the fields.ﬂ  and he wept.stenne, covered with shame, hung his head.the sentry looked at them a moment, andcast a glance at the deserted road.ﬁhurry up,ﬂ he said, stepping aside; and there they were upon the aubervilliers road.how the tallfellow laughed!confusedly, as in a dream, little stenne saw factories transformed into barracks, abandoned barricadescovered with wet rags, long chimneys cutting the mist and rising into the sky, smokeless and broken.atintervals, a sentry, beplumed officers looking into the distance with field-glasses, and small tentsdrenched with melted snow in front of dying fires.the tall fellow knew the roads and cut across thefields to avoid the outposts.however, they fell in with a patrol of sharp-shooters, whom they could notavoid.the sharp-shooters were in their little cabins, perched on the edge of a ditch filled with water,along the soissons railroad.that time the tall fellow repeated his story in vain; they would not allowthem to pass.then, while he was complaining, an old sergeant, all wrinkled and grizzled, who resembledfather stenne, came out of the guardhouse to the road.ﬁcome, little brats, i wouldn™t cry!ﬂ he said to the children; ﬁwe™ll let you go to get your potatoes, butcome in and warm yourselves a little first.this little fellow looks as if he was frozen!ﬂ  alas!it was not with cold that little stenne was tremblingšit was with fear, with shame.in theguard-house they found several soldiers crouching about a paltry fire, a genuine widow™s fire, by the heatof which they were thawing out biscuit on the points of their bayonets.they moved closer together tomake room for the children.they gave them a little coffee.while they have were drinking, an officercame to the door, called to the sergeant, spoke to him in an undertone and hurried away.ﬁmy boys,ﬂ said the sergeant, returning with a radiant face, ﬁthere will be something up to-night.theyhave found out the prussians™ countersign.i believe that this time we shall capture that infernal bourgetagain.ﬂ  there was a explosion of cheers and laughter.they danced and sang and brandished theirsword-bayonets; and the children, taking advantage of the tumult, disappeared.when they had passed the railway there was nothing before them but a level plain, and in the distance along, blank wall, riddled with loopholes.it was towards that wall that they bent their steps, stoopingconstantly to make it appear that they were picking up potatoes.ﬁlet™s go back, let™s not go on,ﬂ said little stenne again and again.the other shrugged his shoulders and kept on.suddenly they heard the click of a gun being cocked.ﬁlie down!ﬂ said the tall fellow, throwing himself on the ground.when they were down, he whistled.another whistled.another whistle answered over the snow.theycrawled on.in front of the wall, level with the ground, appeared a pair of yellow mustaches beneath asoiled cap.the tall youth jumped into the trench, beside the prussian.ﬁthis is my brother,ﬂ he said, pointing to his companion.little stenne was so little, that at the sight of him the prussian began to laugh, and he was obliged totake him in his arms to lift him up to the breach.on the other side of the wall were great piles of earth, felled trees, black holes in the snow, and in eachhole the same dirty cap and the same yellow mustaches, laughing when they saw the children pass.in the corner was a gardener™s house casemated with trunks of trees.the lower room was full ofsoldiers playing cards, and cooking soup over a big, blazing fire.the cabbages and pork smelled good;what a contrast to the bivouac of the sharp-shooters!above were the officers.they could hear themplaying the piano and opening champagne.when the parisian entered, a joyous cheer greeted them.theyproduced their newspapers; then they were given drink and were induced to talk.all the officers had ahaughty and disdainful manner; but the tall youth amused them with his faubourgian wit, his streetarab™s vocabulary.they laughed, repeated his phrases after him, and wallowed with delight in theparisian mud which he brought them.little stenne would have liked to talk too, to prove that he was not stupid, but something embarrassedhim.opposite him, apart from the rest, was an older and graver prussian, who was reading, or ratherseemed to be reading, for his eyes did not leave little stenne.affection and reproach were in his glanceas if he had at home a child of the same age as stenne, and as if he were saying to himself:  ﬁi would rather die than see my son engaged in such business.ﬂ  from that moment stenne felt as it were a hand resting on his heart, which prevented it from beating.to escape that torture, he began to drink.soon everything about him whirled around.he heard vaguely,amid loud laughter, his comrade making fun of the national guards, of their manner of drilling; heimitated a call to arms in the marais, a night alarm on the ramparts.then the tall fellow lowered hisvoice, the officers drew nearer to him, and their faces became serious.the villain was warning them ofthe attack of the sharp-shooters.at that little stenne sprang to his feet in a rage, thoroughly sober:  ﬁnot that!i won™t have it!ﬂ  but the other simply laughed and kept on.before he had finished, all the officers were standing.one ofthem pointed to the door and said to the children:  ﬁclear out!ﬂ  and they began to talk among themselves very rapidly, in german.the tall youth went out as proud as a prince, jingling his money.stenne followed him, hanging hishead; and when he passed the prussian whose glance had embarrassed him so, he heard a sad voice say:  ﬁnot a nice thing to do, that.not a nice thing.ﬂ  tears came to his eyes.once in the field, the children began to run and returned quickly to the city.their bag was full ofpotatoes which the prussians had given them.with them they passed unhindered to the trench of thesharp-shooters.there they were preparing for the night attack.troops came up silently and massedbehind the walls.the old sergeant was there, busily engaged in posting his men, with such a happyexpression.when the children passed, he recognised them and bestowed a pleasant smile upon them.oh!how that smile hurt little stenne!for a moment he was tempted to call out:  ﬁdon™t go there; we have betrayed you.ﬂ  but the other had told him: ﬁif you speak we shall be shotﬂ; and fear restrained him.at la courneuve, they entered an abandoned house to divide the money.truth compels me to state thatthe division was made honestly, and that little stenne™s crime did not seem so terrible to him when heheard the coins jingling under his blouse, and thought of the games of galoche which he had in prospect.but when he was alone, the wretched child!when the tall fellow had left him at the gate, then hispockets began to be very heavy, and the hand that grasped his heart grasped it tighter than ever.paris didnot seem the same to him.the people who passed gazed sternly at him as if they knew whence he came.he heard the word ﬁspyﬂ in the rumbling of the wheels, in the beating of the drums along the canal.atlast he reached home, and, overjoyed to find that his father was not there, he went quickly up to theirroom, to hide under his pillow that money that weighed so heavily upon him.never had father stenne been so joyous and so good-humoured as when he returned that night.newshad been received from the provinces: affairs were looking better.as he ate, the old soldier looked at hismusket hanging on the wall, and said to the child with his hearty laugh:  ﬁi say, my boy, how you would go at the prussians if you were big!ﬂ  above eight o™clock, they heard cannon.ﬁthat is aubervilliers.they are fighting at bourget,ﬂ said the good man, who knew all the forts.littlestenne turned pale, and, on the plea that he was very tired, he went to bed; but he did not sleep.thecannon still roared.he imagined the sharp-shooters arriving in the dark to surprise the prussians, andthemselves falling into an ambush.he remembered the sergeant who had smiled at him and he saw himstretched out on the snow, and many others with him.the price of all that blood was concealed thereunder his pillow, and it was he, the son of monsieur stenne, of a soldierštears choked him.in theadjoining room he heard his father walk to the window and open it.below on the square, the recall wassounding; and a battalion was forming to leave the city.evidently it was a real battle.the unhappy childcloud not restrain a sob.ﬁwhat™s the matter with you?ﬂ asked father stenne as he entered the room.the child could not stand it any longer; he leaped out of bed and threw himself at his father™s feet.atthe movement that he made the silver pieces rolled on the floor.ﬁwhat is all this?have you been stealing?ﬂ demanded the old man, trembling.thereupon, without pausing for breath, little stenne told him that he had been to the prussian quartersand of what he had done there.as he spoke, his heart felt freer; it relieved him to accuse himself.father stenne listened, with a terribleface.when it was at an end, he hid face in his hands and wept.ﬁfather, fatheršﬂ the child began.the old man pushed him away without replying, and picked up the money.ﬁis this all?ﬂ he asked.little stenne motioned that it was all.the old man took down his musket and cartridge box, and said ashe put the money in his pocket:  ﬁall right; i am going to return it to them.ﬂ  and without another word, without even turning his head, he went down and joined the troops whowere marching away in the darkness.he was never seen again.4.the game of billiardsas they have been fighting two days, and have passed the night with their knapsacks on, beneath a floodof rain, the soldiers are completely exhausted.and yet for three mortal hours they have been left waiting,with grounded arms, in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fields.benumbed by fatigue, by sleepless nights, and with their uniforms drenched with rain, they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one another.there are some who sleep standing, leaning against aneighbour™s knapsack, and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed faces,overcome with sleep.rain, mud, no fire, nothing to eat, a low, black sky, and the enemy in the air about.it is funereal.what are they doing there?what is going on?the guns, with their muzzles pointed towards the wood,have the appearance of watching something.the mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the horizon.everything seems ready for an attack.why do they not attack?what are they waiting for?they are awaiting orders, and headquarters sends none.and yet the headquarters are not far away.theyare at yonder stately louis-treize château, whose red bricks, scoured by the rain, glisten among the treeshalf-way up the hill.truly a princely dwelling, quite worthy to bear the banner of a marshal of france.behind a broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road, smooth green lawns, lined withvases of flowers, extend to the porch.on the other side, the private side of the house, the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps; the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror, and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary, peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage, uttering shrill cries amid the foliage.although the owners have gone away, one does notfeel the abandonment, the desolation of war.the oriflamme of the leader of the army has safeguardedeven the tiniest flowers in the lawns, and it is an impressive thing to find so near the battle-field thatopulent tranquillity that is born of perfect order, of the accurate alignment of the shrubbery, of the silentdepths of the avenues.the rain, which fills the roads yonder with such disgusting mud, and digs such deep ruts, here isnothing more than an elegant, aristocratic shower, reviving the red of the bricks and the green of thelawns, polishing the leaves of the orange-trees and the white feathers of the swans.everything glistens,everything is peaceful.really, but for the flag floating on the roof, but for the two soldiers on sentry-gobefore the gate, one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an army.the horses are resting inthe stables.here and there one sees a groom, or an orderly in undress uniform, loitering about thekitchen, or a gardener in red trousers placidly drawing his rake over the gravel in the great courtyards.the dining-room, the windows of which look upon the porch, discloses a half-cleared table; uncorkedbottles, soiled and empty glasses on the rumpled cloth; the end of a banquet, after the guests have gone.in the adjoining room one may hear loud voices, laughter, the clicking of balls and the clinking ofglasses.the marshal is playing his game of billiards, and that is why the army is waiting for orders.when the marshal had begun his game, the heavens might fall, but nothing in the world could preventhim from finishing it.billiards!that is the weakness of that great warrior.he stands there, as grave as in battle, in fulluniform, his breast covered with medals, with kindled eyes, flushed cheeks, excited by feasting, grog,and the game.his aides-de-camp surround him, zealous and respectful.uttering admiring exclamations ateach of his strokes.when the marshal makes a point, they all hasten to mark it; when the marshal isthirsty, they all rush to prepare his grog.there is a constant rustling of epaulettes and plumes, a jinglingof medals; and to see all those sweet smiles, those artful, courtierlike reverences, all those new uniformsand embroidery in that lofty apartment, with its oaken wainscoting, looking upon parks and courts ofhonour, recalls the autumn days at compiègne, and affords the eyes a little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads, forming such sombre groups in the rain.the marshal™s opponent is a young captain of the staff, belted and curled and light-gloved, who is in thefirst rank of billiard-players and capable of beating all the marshals on earth; but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief, and devotes his energies to the task of not winning, and at the sametime not losing too easily.he is what is called an officer with a future.attention, young man, let us be on our guard!the marshal has fifteen, and you ten.the point is to keepthe game in that condition to the end; then you will have done more for your promotion than if you wereoutside with the others, beneath those torrents of water which drown the horizon, soiling your nattyuniform, tarnishing the gold of your aiguillettes, awaiting orders which do not come.it is really an interesting game.the balls roll and clash and mingle their colours.the cushions sendthem merrily back; the cloth waxes hot.suddenly the flash of a cannon-shot passes across the sky.a dullsound rattles the windows.everybody starts, and they look at each other anxiously.the marshal alonehas neither seen nor heard anything; leaning over the table, he is busily engaged in planning amagnificent draw-shot; draw-shots are his strong point.but there comes another flash, then another.the cannon-shots succeed each other in hot haste.theaides-de-camp run to the windows.can it be that the prussians are attacking.ﬁvery well, let them attack!ﬂ says the marshal, chalking his cue.ﬁit™s your turn, captain.ﬂ  the staff quivers with admiration.turenne asleep upon a gun-carriage was nothing compared to thismarshal, who plays billiards so tranquilly at the moment of going into action.meanwhile the uproarredoubles.with the roar of the cannon is mingled the tearing sound of the mitrailleuses, the rattle ofmusketry.a red steam, black at the edges, rises around the lawns.the whole park is on fire.the terrifiedpeacocks and pheasants shriek in the aviary; the arabian horses, smelling the powder, rear in the stables.the headquarters begins to be excited.despatch after despatch.couriers arrive at full speed.they askfor the marshal.the marshal cannot be seen.did i not tell you that nothing could prevent him from finishing his game?ﬁit is your turn, captain.ﬂ  but the captain is distraught.that is what it is to be young.behold he loses his head, forgets his tactics,and makes two runs in succession, which almost give him the game.thereupon the marshal becomesfurious.surprise and indignation animate his manly face.just at this moment a horse ridden at a hardgallop rushes into the courtyard.an aide-de-camp covered with mud forces his way past the sentries andascends the steps at one bound.ﬁmarshal, marshal!ﬂ you should see how he is greeted.puffing withanger and red as a rooster, the marshal appears at the window, his billiard-cue in his hand:  ﬁwhat™s the matter?what™s all this?isn™t there any sentry there?ﬂ  ﬁbut, marshalššﬂ  ﬁall right, in a moment; wait for my orders, in god™s name!ﬂ  and the window is violently closed.wait for his orders!that is just what they are doing, the poor fellows.the wind drives the rain and thegrapeshot full in their faces.whole battalions are wiped out, while others stand useless, with their armsin readiness, utterly unable to understand their inaction.nothing to do.they are awaiting orders.however, as one needs no orders to die, the men fall by hundreds behind the shrubs, in the moats, infront of the great silent château.even after they have fallen, the grape tears them still, and from the openwounds the generous blood of france flows noiselessly.above, in the billiard-room, it is getting terriblywarm too; the marshal has recovered his lead, but the little captain is defending himself like a lion.seventeen!eighteen!nineteen!they hardly have time to mark the points.the roar of the battle draws nearer.the marshal has but onemore to go.already shells are falling in the park.suddenly one bursts over the pond.the mirror isshattered; a swan in deadly alarm swims wildly about amid an eddy of bloody feathers.that is the laststroke.then, a profound silence.only the rain falling on the hedges, a confused rumbling at the foot of the hill,and, along the muddy roads, a sound like the trampling of a hurrying flock.the army is in full retreat.the marshal has won his game.5.the bad zouavethat evening the big blacksmith, lory of sainte-marie-aux-mines, was not happy.when the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set, it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor, tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day™s work.beforehe sent home his apprentices, he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them, while hewatched the workers coming out of the factories.but that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper, and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leave.as his old wife looked at him, she thought.ﬁwhat can have happened to him?can he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom me?perhaps the older of the boys is sickššﬂ  but she dared not question him, and busied herself quieting three little tow-headed rascals, brown asears of parched corn, who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and cream.at last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried,  ﬁah, what brutes, what curs!ﬂ  ﬁcome, lory, who are you talking about?ﬂ said his wife.he shouted,  ﬁi am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in their frenchuniforms, arm in arm with the bavariansšmore of those fellows who havešhow do they sayit?š‚chosen prussian citizenship.™ and to think that every day we seeing such false alsatians comeback!what can they have given the scoundrels to drink anyway?ﬂ  the mother tried to defend them.ﬁmy poor husband, what do you expect?those boys are not entirely to blame.they are sent to algeria,so far away in africa!they get home-sick out there, and their temptation is very strong to come back andnot be soldiers any longer.ﬂ  lory struck the table a heavy blow with his fist.ﬁbe still, mother!you women-folk understand nothing at all.you live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubs.i tell you, those fellows areragamuffins, renegades, the worst sort of scoundrels!if bad luck ever made our own christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct, as surely as my name is george lory, seven years chasseur in the army offrance, i would run him through the body with my saber!ﬂ  terrible to look upon, he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur™s saber, which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave, taken out there in africa.but merely to look at that honest alsatian face,šburned almost black by the sun, the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness aroundšthat was enough to quiet himsuddenly.he began to laugh.ﬁi am a fine fellow to be losing my head this way!as if our christian could dream of turningprussianšchristian, who bowled over such a lot of them in the war!ﬂ  brought back to good humour by this idea, the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal, and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the ville de strasbourg.the old woman was now left alone.she had put the small blond scamps to bed; they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleep.she picked up her work, and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the house.once in a while she sighed, and she thought,  ﬁof coursešthere can be no doubt of itšthey are scoundrels and renegadesšbut, what of it?theirmothers are glad to see them again.ﬂ  and she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day, getting ready to work in the garden.she looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans: her boy, in his blouse, with his long hair, that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the zouaves.suddenly she trembled.the little gate at the backšthe gate which led to the fields,šhad been opened.the dogs had not barked, though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief, andslipped in among the beehives.ﬁgood-day, mother!ﬂ  his uniform all awry, there stood before her christian, her son, anxious, shame-faced, andthick-tongued.the wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house, waiting for his father to go out.she wanted to scold him, but she had not the courage.how long it was since she had seen him, had hugged him!and then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return!šhow he had grown weary for his native countryside, for the smithy:šweary ofliving always so far away from them all, and of the disciplinešmuch harsher of latešas well as of hiscomrades, who called him ﬁprussianﬂ because of his alsatian accent.she believed every word he said.she had only to look at him to believe him.deep in their talk, they went into the lower room.the littleones woke up, and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brother.he was urged to eat,but he was not hungry.he was only thirsty, always thirsty; and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the inn.but some one was coming into the yard.it was the black-smith returning.ﬁchristian, here comes your father.quick, hide until i have time to talk with him and explain.ﬂ  she pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghands.but as ill fortune would have it, the zouave™s cap lay upon the table, and it was the first thinglory noticed as he entered.the mother™s pallor, and her agitationšhe understood it all.ﬁchristian is here!ﬂ he cried, in a terrible voice.taking down his saber with a mad gesture, he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the zouave, pale, sobered, and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from falling.the mother threw herself between them.ﬁlory, lory!don™t kill him!he came back because i wrote that you needed him at the forge!ﬂ  she riveted her hold upon his arm, and dragged him back, sobbing.the children, in the darkness oftheir room, began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears, and so thick that they didnot know them.the smith stood still and looked at his wife.ﬁoh!ﬂ he said.ﬁso it was you who made him come back!very well.it is time he went to bed.i shalldecide to-morrow what i must do.ﬂ  christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors, tofind himself in the room he had used as a child.already warm and well up in the sky, the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the window.hammers wereringing on the anvil below.his mother sat by his pillow: she had been so afraid of her husband™s angerthat she had not stirred from there all night.nor had the father gone to bed.till the first dawn, he hadwalked through the house weeping, sighing, opening and closing closets.he now entered his son™s room.he was very grave and dressed for a journey.he wore his high gaiters and his big hat, and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferule.he went straight to the bed.ﬁcome, get up!ﬂ  dazed, the boy made as if to get his zouave equipment.ﬁno, not that!ﬂ said the father, sternly.the mother, all apprehension, said,  ﬁbut, my dear, he has no other things.ﬂ  ﬁgive him mine.i shall not need them again.ﬂ  while the boy dressed, lory carefully packed the uniform, with its little vest and its huge red trousers.as soon as he had made the package, he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches.ﬁnow let us go down,ﬂ he said; and all three without a word descended to the smithy.the blast roared.everyone was at work.when christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in algeria, he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there, between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dust.he felt a sudden flood of tenderness, a great longing to be pardoned by his father; but whenever he raisedhis eyes, he met an inexorable look.at last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak.ﬁboy,ﬂ he said, ﬁthere stands the anvil with the tools.they are all yours.and so is all this.ﬂ heindicated the little garden which lay beyond, filled with sunshine and with bees, and framed by the sootysquare of the door.ﬁthe hives, the vine, the house itself,šthey are all yours.you sacrificed your honour for these things.the least you can do is to take care of them.now you are master here.as for myself, i shall go away.you owe five years to france: i am going to pay them for you.ﬂ  ﬁlory, lory!™ cried the poor old wife, ﬁwhere are you going?ﬂ  ﬁfather!ﬂ begged the son.but the blacksmith was already on his way.he walked with great strides and did not turn back.at sidi-bel-abbés, the dépôt of the third zouaves, there enlisted some days later a volunteer who gavehis age as fifty-five years.footnotesnote 1.  ﬁs™il tient sa langue, il tient la clé qui de ses chaines le delivre.ﬂšmistral.[back]bibliographic recordauthor: daudet, alphonse, 1840œ1897.title: five short stories, by alphonse daudet.series: the harvard classics shelf of fiction, selected by charles w. eliot, with notes and introductionsby william allan neilson.published: new york: p.f.collier & son, 1917.physical details: vol.13, part 4, of 20;

too much bored we would read him a letter from hissonšan imaginary letter of course for nothing was allowed to enter paris and since sedanmacmahon™s aidedecamp had been sent to a german fortressyou

listen religiously smile with a knowing airapprove criticise and explain to us the passages that seemed a little confusedbut where he wasespecially grand was in the replies that he sent to his son‚never forget that you are a frenchman™ hewould say to him‚be generous to those poor peopledon™t make the invasion too hard for them™ andthere were recommendations without end admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerorshe interspersed also some general considerations upon

in therippert field behind the sawmill the prussians going through their drillall that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles but i had the strength to resist and i ran as fast as icould to schoolas i passed the mayor™s office i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were postedfor two years all our bad news had come from that boardšbattles lostconscriptions orders from headquarters and i thought without stopping  ﬁwhat can it be nowﬂ  then as i ran across the square wachter the blacksmith who stood there with his apprentice readingthe placard called out to me  ﬁdon™t hurry so my boy you™ll get to your school soon enoughﬂ  i thought that he was making fun of me and i ran into monsieur hamel™s little yard all out of breathusually at the beginning of school there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street desksopening and closing lessons repeated aloud in unison with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker andthe teacher™s stout ruler beating on the desk  ﬁa little more quietﬂ  i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed but as it happened that day everything wasquiet like a sunday morningthrough the open window i saw my comrades already in their places andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his armi had no open the doorand enter in the midst of that perfect silenceyou can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraidbut nomonsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently  ﬁgo at once to your seat my little frantz we were going to begin without youﬂ  i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desknot until then when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat his plaited ruff and the blacksilk embroidered breeches which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizesmoreover there was something extraordinary something solemn about the whole classbut whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room on the benches which were usually empty somepeople from the village sitting as silent as we were old hauser with his threecornered hat theexmayor the expostman and others besidesthey all seemed depressed and hauser had brought anold spellingbook with gnawed edges which he held wideopen on his knee with his great spectaclesaskewwhile i was wondering at all this monsieur hamel had mounted his platform and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me he said to us  ﬁmy children this is

before i thought so tiresome so heavy tocarryšmy grammar my sacred historyšseemed to me now like old friends from whom i should beterribly grieved to partand it was the same about monsieur hamelthe thought that he was goingaway that i should never see him again made me forget the punishments the blows with the rulerpoor manit was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the roomit seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the schoolit was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishingi was at that point in my reflections when i heard my name calledit was my turn to recitewhat wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles in a louddistinct voice without a slipbut i got mixed up at the first words and i stood there swaying against mybench with a full heart afraid to raise my headi heard monsieur hamel speaking to me  ﬁi will not scold you my little frantz you must be punished enough that is the way it goes every daywe say to ourselves ‚pshawi have time enoughi will learn tomorrow™ and then you see whathappensahit has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untiltomorrownow those people are entitled to say to us ‚whatyou claim to be french and you canneither speak nor write your language™ in all this my poor frantz you are not the guiltiest onewe allhave

to have a few more sousand have i nothing to reproachmyself forhave i not often made you water my garden instead of studyingand when i wanted to gofishing for trout have i ever hesitated to dismiss youﬂ  then passing from one thing to another monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world the most clear the mostsubstantial that we must always retain it among ourselves and never forget it because when a peoplefalls into servitude ﬁso long as it clings to its language it is as if it held the key to its prisonﬂ 1 then hetook the grammer and read us our lessoni was amazed to see how readily i understoodeverything thathe said seemed so easy to me so easyi believed too that i had never listened so closely and that he forhis part had never been so patient with his explanationsone would have said that before going awaythe poor man desired to give us all his knowledge to force it all into our heads at a single blowwhen the lesson was at an end we passed to writingfor that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples on which was written in a fine round hand ﬁfrance alsace france alsaceﬂthey were like little flags waving all about the class hanging from the rods of our desksyou shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it wasnothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens

to sing in german tooﬂ  from time to time when i raised my eyes from my paperi saw monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in

polished and rubbed by use thewalnuts in the yard had grown and the hopvine which he himself had planted now festooned thewindows even to the roofwhat a heartrending thing it must have been for that

which he found only miserygoing up to paris he joined his elder brother ernest who wasthen trying to get a foothold in journalismat eighteen he published a volume of poems ﬁ lesamoureuses ﬂ wrote for the ﬁ figaro ﬂ and began experimenting with playwritinghe attracted theattention of the duc de morny who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in lifehis first notable success came in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-six with his ﬁ lettres de mon moulin ﬂ a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy and this was followed up by a longer work ﬁ le petit chose ﬂ apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youthin one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-two he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing ﬁ tartarin of tarascon ﬂ probably the most vital of all his creationsin ﬁ fromont jeune etrisler a î n éﬂ he created another great character delobelle the brokendown actor and he took captive thereading world by his

him to membership ﬁ tartarin ﬂ reappeared in all his buoyancy in ﬁ tartarin surles alpes ﬂ and less successfully as a colonist in ﬁ porttarascon ﬂ some volumes of reminiscences aconsiderable number of short stories some delightful tales for children and a few plays complete the listof his more important writingshe died at paris on december seventeen one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-seven daudet was especially distinguished for his stylehe wrote with a great impression of ease yet heobtained an effect of great brilliance and felicityhe belonged to the realistic school and though heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleaguesnone of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories and

grand was in the replies that he sent to his son ‚ never forget that you are a frenchman ™ hewould say to him ‚ be generous to those poor peopledon ™ t make the invasion too hard for them ™ andthere were recommendations without end admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerorshe

especially asmonsieur hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles and i did not know the first thingabout themfor a moment i thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fieldsit wassuch a warm lovely dayi could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood and in therippert field behind the sawmill the prussians going through their drillall that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles but i had the strength to resist and i ran as fast as icould to schoolas i passed the mayor ™ s office i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were postedfor two years all our bad news had come from that board š battles lostconscriptions orders from headquarters and i thought without stopping ﬁ what can it be now ﬂ then as i ran across the square wachter the blacksmith who stood there with his apprentice readingthe placard called out to me ﬁ don ™ t hurry so my boy you ™ ll get to your school soon enough ﬂ i thought that he was making fun of me and i ran into monsieur hamel ™ s little yard all out of breathusually at the beginning of school there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street desksopening and closing lessons repeated aloud in unison with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker andthe teacher ™ s stout ruler beating on the desk ﬁ a little more quiet ﬂ i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed but as it happened that day everything wasquiet like a sunday morningthrough the open window i saw my comrades already in their places andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his armi had no open the doorand enter in the midst of that perfect silenceyou can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraidbut nomonsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently ﬁ go at once to your seat my little frantz we were going to begin without you ﬂ i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desknot until then when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat his plaited ruff and the blacksilk embroidered breeches which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizesmoreover there was something extraordinary something solemn about the whole classbut whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room on the benches which were usually empty somepeople from the village sitting as silent as we were old hauser with his threecornered hat theexmayor the expostman and others besidesthey all seemed depressed and hauser had brought anold spellingbook with gnawed edges which he held wideopen on his knee with his great spectaclesaskewwhile i was wondering at all this monsieur hamel had mounted his platform and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me he said to us ﬁ my children this is the last time that i shall teach youorders have come from berlin to teach nothingbut german in the schools of alsace and lorrainethe new teacher arrives tomorrowthis is the lastclass in french so i beg you to be very attentive ﬂ those few words overwhelmed meahthe villainsthat was what they had posted at the mayor ™ sofficemy last class in frenchand i barely knew how to writeso i should never learni must stop short where i washow angry iwas with myself because of the time i had wasted the lessons i had missed running about after nests orsliding on the saarmy books which only a moment before i thought so tiresome so heavy tocarry š my grammar my sacred history š seemed to me now like old friends from whom i should beterribly grieved to partand it was the same about monsieur hamelthe thought that he was goingaway that i should never see him again made me forget the punishments the blows with the rulerpoor manit was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the roomit seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the schoolit was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishingi was at that point in my reflections when i heard my name calledit was my turn to recitewhat wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles in a louddistinct voice without a slipbut i got mixed up at the first words and i stood there swaying against mybench with a full heart afraid to raise my headi heard monsieur hamel speaking to me ﬁ i will not scold you my little frantz you must be punished enough that is the way it goes every daywe say to ourselves ‚ pshawi have time enoughi will learn tomorrow ™ and then you see whathappensahit has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untiltomorrownow those people are entitled to say to us ‚ whatyou claim to be french and you

you water my garden instead of studyingand when i wanted to gofishing for trout have i ever hesitated to dismiss you ﬂ then passing from one thing to another monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world the most clear the mostsubstantial that we must always retain it among ourselves and never forget it because when a peoplefalls into servitude ﬁ so long as it clings to its language it is as if it held the key to its prison ﬂ one then hetook the grammer and read us our lessoni was amazed to see how readily i understoodeverything thathe said seemed so easy to me so easyi believed too that i had never listened so closely and that he forhis part had never been so patient with his explanationsone would have said that before going awaythe poor man desired to give us all his knowledge to force it all into our heads at a single blowwhen the lesson was at an end we passed to writingfor that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples on which was written in a fine round hand ﬁ france alsace france alsace ﬂ they were like little flags waving all about the class hanging from the rods of

attention to them noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines with a will and conscientiousapplication as if even the lines were frenchon the roof of the schoolhouse

monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhousethink of itfor forty years he had been there in the same place with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it wasbut the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use thewalnuts in the yard had grown and the hopvine which he

knapsacks on beneath a floodof rain the soldiers are completely exhaustedand yet for three mortal hours they have been left waitingwith grounded arms in the puddles of the highroads and the mud of the saturated fieldsbenumbed by fatigue by sleepless nights and with their uniforms drenched with rain they crowdtogether to warm and comfort one anotherthere are some who sleep standing leaning against aneighbour ™ s knapsack and weariness and privations can be read distinctly upon those relaxed facesovercome with sleeprain mud no fire nothing to eat a low black sky and the enemy in the air aboutit is funerealwhat are they doing therewhat is going onthe guns with their muzzles pointed towards the woodhave the appearance of watching somethingthe mitrailleurs in ambush stare fixedly at the

broad moat and a stone wall which separate them from the road smooth green lawns lined withvases of flowers extend to the porchon the other side the private side of the house the hornbeamhedges show luminous gaps the pond in which swans are swimming lies like a mirror and beneath thepagodalike roof of an enormous aviary peacocks and golden pheasants flash their wings and displaytheir plumage

green of thelawns polishing the leaves of the orangetrees and the white feathers of the swanseverything glistenseverything is peacefulreally but for the flag floating on the roof but for the two soldiers on sentrygobefore the gate one would never suspect that it is the headquarters of an armythe horses are resting inthe stableshere and there one sees a groom or an orderly in undress uniform

little rest from the stained cloaksthat shiver yonder along the roads forming such sombre groups in the rainthe marshal ™ s opponent is a young captain of the staff belted and curled and lightgloved who is in thefirst rank of billiardplayers and capable of beating all the marshals on earth but he has the tact to keep arespectful distance behind his chief and devotes his energies to the task of

the big blacksmith lory of saintemarieauxmines was not happywhen the smithy fire had gone down and the sun had set it was his custom to sit on a bench before hisdoor tasting that grateful weariness which is the reward of heavy labor and of a hot day ™ s workbeforehe sent home his apprentices he would drink several deep glasses of cool beer with them while hewatched the workers coming out of the factoriesbut that evening the good blacksmith remained at his forge until it was time for his supper and eventhen he went as if he regretted to leaveas his old wife looked at him she thought ﬁ what can have happened to himcan he have received bad news from the regiment and be hiding itfrom meperhaps the older of the boys is sick ššﬂ but she dared not question him and busied herself quieting three little towheaded rascals brown asears of parched corn who were laughing around the table as they crunched their good salad of blackradishes and creamat last the blacksmith pushed back his plate in a rage and cried ﬁ ah what brutes what curs ﬂ ﬁ come lory who are you talking about ﬂ said his wifehe shouted ﬁ i am talking of five or six scamps who were seen this morning parading the town in

the body with my saber ﬂ terrible to look upon he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur ™ s saber which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave taken out there in africabut merely to look at that honest alsatian face š burned almost black by the sun the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness around š that was enough to quiet himsuddenlyhe began to laugh ﬁ i am a fine fellow to be losing my head this wayas if our christian could dream of turningprussian š christian who bowled over such a lot of them in the war ﬂ brought back to good humour by this idea the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the ville de strasbourgthe old woman was now left

again ﬂ and she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day getting ready to work in the gardenshe looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans her boy in his blouse with his long hair that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the zouavessuddenly she trembledthe little gate at the back š the gate

the ﬁ figaro ﬂ and began experimenting with playwritinghe attracted theattention of the duc de morny who made him one of his secretaries and in various ways helped him to astart in lifehis first notable success came in one thousand, eight hundred and sixty-six with his ﬁ lettres de mon moulin ﬂ a series of sketches andstories of great charm and delicacy and this was followed up by a longer work ﬁ le petit chose ﬂ apathetic fiction based upon his own unhappy youthin one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-two he produced the first of his three volumes onthe amazing ﬁ tartarin of tarascon ﬂ probably the most vital of all his creationsin ﬁ fromont jeune etrisler a î n éﬂ he created another great character delobelle the brokendown actor and he took captive thereading world by his

heachieved a very living sense of actuality he escaped the cynicism and brutality that marked the work ofsome of his colleaguesnone of his work is more perfect of its kind than his short stories and

grand was in the replies that he sent to his son ‚ never forget that you are a frenchman ™ hewould say to him ‚ be generous to those poor peopledon ™ t make the invasion too hard for them ™ andthere were recommendations without end admirable preachments upon respect for the proprieties thecourtesy which should be shown to the ladies a complete code of military honour for the use ofconquerorshe

especially asmonsieur hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles and i did not know the first thingabout themfor a moment i thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fieldsit wassuch a warm lovely dayi could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood and in therippert field behind the sawmill the prussians going through their drillall that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles but i had the strength to resist and i ran as fast as icould to schoolas i passed the mayor ™ s office i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were postedfor two years all our bad news had come from that board š battles lostconscriptions orders from headquarters and i thought without stopping ﬁ what can it be now ﬂ then as i ran across the square wachter the blacksmith who stood there with his apprentice readingthe placard called out to me ﬁ don ™ t hurry so my boy you ™ ll get to your school soon enough ﬂ i thought that he was making fun of me and i ran into monsieur hamel ™ s little yard all out of breathusually at the beginning of school there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street desksopening and closing lessons repeated aloud in unison with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker andthe teacher ™ s stout ruler beating on the desk ﬁ a little more quiet ﬂ i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed but as it happened that day everything wasquiet like a sunday morningthrough the open window i saw my comrades already in their places andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his armi had no open the doorand enter in the midst of that perfect silenceyou can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraidbut nomonsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently ﬁ go at once to your seat my little frantz we were going to begin without you ﬂ i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desknot until then when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat his plaited ruff and the blacksilk embroidered breeches which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizesmoreover there was something extraordinary something solemn about the whole classbut whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room on the benches which were usually empty somepeople from the village sitting as silent as we were old hauser with his threecornered hat theexmayor the expostman and others besidesthey all seemed depressed and hauser had brought anold spellingbook with gnawed edges which he held wideopen on his knee with his great spectaclesaskewwhile i was wondering at all this monsieur hamel had mounted his platform and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me he said to us ﬁ my children this is the last time that i shall teach youorders have come from berlin to teach nothingbut german in the schools of alsace and lorrainethe new teacher arrives tomorrowthis is the lastclass in french so i beg you to be very attentive ﬂ those few words overwhelmed meahthe villainsthat was what they had posted at the mayor ™ sofficemy last class in frenchand i barely knew how to writeso i should never learni must stop short where i washow angry iwas with myself because of the time i had wasted the lessons i had missed running about after nests orsliding on the saarmy books which only a moment before i thought so tiresome so heavy tocarry š my grammar my sacred history š seemed to me now like old friends from whom i should beterribly grieved to partand it was the same about monsieur hamelthe thought that he was goingaway that i should never see him again made me forget the punishments the blows with the rulerpoor manit was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the roomit seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the schoolit was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishingi was at that point in my reflections when i heard my name calledit was my turn to recitewhat wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles in a louddistinct voice without a slipbut i got mixed up at the first words and i stood there swaying against mybench with a full heart afraid to raise my headi heard monsieur hamel speaking to me ﬁ i will not scold you my little frantz you must be punished enough that is the way it goes every daywe say to ourselves ‚ pshawi have time enoughi will learn tomorrow ™ and then you see whathappensahit has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untiltomorrownow those people are entitled to say to us ‚ whatyou claim to be french and you

you water my garden instead of studyingand when i wanted to gofishing for trout have i ever hesitated to dismiss you ﬂ then passing from one thing to another monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world the most clear the mostsubstantial that we must always retain it among ourselves and never forget it because when a peoplefalls into servitude ﬁ so long as it clings to its language it is as if it held the key to its prison ﬂ one then hetook the grammer and read us our lessoni was amazed to see how readily i understoodeverything thathe said seemed so easy to me so easyi believed too that i had never listened so closely and that he forhis part had never been so patient with his explanationsone would have said that before going awaythe poor man desired to give us all his knowledge to force it all into our heads at a single blowwhen the lesson was at an end we passed to writingfor that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples on which was written in a fine round hand ﬁ france alsace france alsace ﬂ they were like little flags waving all about the class hanging from the rods of

attention to them noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines with a will and conscientiousapplication as if even the lines were frenchon the roof of the schoolhouse

monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhousethink of itfor forty years he had been there in the same place with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it wasbut the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use thewalnuts in the yard had grown and the hopvine which he

tuileries the window up there opened softly and thecolonel appeared on the balcony with his helmet his long sword all the glorious old array of one ofmilhaud ™ s cuirassiersi wonder still what effort

especially asmonsieur hamel had told us that he should examine us on participles and i did not know the first thingabout themfor a moment i thought of staying away from school and wandering about the fieldsit wassuch a warm lovely dayi could hear the blackbirds whistling on the edge of the wood and in therippert field behind the sawmill the prussians going through their drillall that was much moretempting to me than the rules concerning participles but i had the strength to resist and i ran as fast as icould to schoolas i passed the mayor ™ s office i saw that there were people gathered about the little board on whichnotices were postedfor two years all our bad news had come from that board š battles lostconscriptions orders from headquarters and i thought without stopping ﬁ what can it be now ﬂ then as i ran across the square wachter the blacksmith who stood there with his apprentice readingthe placard called out to me ﬁ don ™ t hurry so my boy you ™ ll get to your school soon enough ﬂ i thought that he was making fun of me and i ran into monsieur hamel ™ s little yard all out of breathusually at the beginning of school there was a great uproar which could be heard in the street desksopening and closing lessons repeated aloud in unison with our ears stuffed in order to learn quicker andthe teacher ™ s stout ruler beating on the desk ﬁ a little more quiet ﬂ i counted on all this noise to reach my bench unnoticed but as it happened that day everything wasquiet like a sunday morningthrough the open window i saw my comrades already in their places andmonsieur hamel walking back and forth with the terrible iron ruler under his armi had no open the doorand enter in the midst of that perfect silenceyou can imagine whether i blushed and whether i wasafraidbut nomonsieur hamel looked at me with no sign of anger and said very gently ﬁ go at once to your seat my little frantz we were going to begin without you ﬂ i stepped over the bench and sat down at once at my desknot until then when i had partly recoveredfrom my fright did i notice that our teacher had on his handsome blue coat his plaited ruff and the blacksilk embroidered breeches which he wore only on days of inspection or of distribution of prizesmoreover there was something extraordinary something solemn about the whole classbut whatsurprised me most was to see at the back of the room on the benches which were usually empty somepeople from the village sitting as silent as we were old hauser with his threecornered hat theexmayor the expostman and others besidesthey all seemed depressed and hauser had brought anold spellingbook with gnawed edges which he held wideopen on his knee with his great spectaclesaskewwhile i was wondering at all this monsieur hamel had mounted his platform and in the same gentleand serious voice with which he had welcomed me he said to us ﬁ my children this is the last time that i shall teach youorders have come from berlin to teach nothingbut german in the schools of alsace and lorrainethe new teacher arrives tomorrowthis is the lastclass in french so i beg you to be very attentive ﬂ those few words overwhelmed meahthe villainsthat was what they had posted at the mayor ™ sofficemy last class in frenchand i barely knew how to writeso i should never learni must stop short where i washow angry iwas with myself because of the time i had wasted the lessons i had missed running about after nests orsliding on the saarmy books which only a moment before i thought so tiresome so heavy tocarry š my grammar my sacred history š seemed to me now like old friends from whom i should beterribly grieved to partand it was the same about monsieur hamelthe thought that he was goingaway that i should never see him again made me forget the punishments the blows with the rulerpoor manit was in honour of that last lesson that he had put on his fine sunday clothes and iunderstood now why those old fellows from the village were sitting at the end of the roomit seemed tomean that they regretted not having come oftener to the schoolit was also a way of thanking our teacherfor his forty years of faithful service and of paying their respects to the fatherland which was vanishingi was at that point in my reflections when i heard my name calledit was my turn to recitewhat wouldi not have given to be able to say from beginning to end that famous rule about participles in a louddistinct voice without a slipbut i got mixed up at the first words and i stood there swaying against mybench with a full heart afraid to raise my headi heard monsieur hamel speaking to me ﬁ i will not scold you my little frantz you must be punished enough that is the way it goes every daywe say to ourselves ‚ pshawi have time enoughi will learn tomorrow ™ and then you see whathappensahit has been the great misfortune of our alsace always to postpone its lessons untiltomorrownow those people are entitled to say to us ‚ whatyou claim to be french and you

you water my garden instead of studyingand when i wanted to gofishing for trout have i ever hesitated to dismiss you ﬂ then passing from one thing to another monsieur hamel began to talk to us about the frenchlanguage saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world the most clear the mostsubstantial that we must always retain it among ourselves and never forget it because when a peoplefalls into servitude ﬁ so long as it clings to its language it is as if it held the key to its prison ﬂ one then hetook the grammer and read us our lessoni was amazed to see how readily i understoodeverything thathe said seemed so easy to me so easyi believed too that i had never listened so closely and that he forhis part had never been so patient with his explanationsone would have said that before going awaythe poor man desired to give us all his knowledge to force it all into our heads at a single blowwhen the lesson was at an end we passed to writingfor that day monsieur hamel had prepared someentirely new examples on which was written in a fine round hand ﬁ france alsace france alsace ﬂ they were like little flags waving all about the class hanging from the rods of our desksyou shouldhave seen how hard we all worked and how silent it wasnothing could be heard save the grinding of thepens over the paperat one time some cockchafers flew in but no one paid any attention to them noteven the little fellows who were struggling with their straight lines with a will and conscientiousapplication as if even the lines were frenchon the roof of the schoolhouse pigeons cooed in low tonesand i said to myself as i listened to them ﬁ i wonder if they are going to compel them to sing in german too ﬂ from time to time when i raised my eyes from my paperi saw monsieur hamel sitting motionless inhis chair and staring at the objects about him as if he wished to carry away in his glance the whole of hislittle schoolhousethink of itfor forty years he had been there in the same place with his yard in frontof him and his class just as it wasbut the benches and desks were polished and rubbed by use thewalnuts in the yard had grown and the hopvine which he

womenfolk understand nothing at allyou live so much with children and solittle for anything else that you become exactly the size of your cubsi tell you those fellows areragamuffins renegades the worst sort of scoundrelsif bad luck ever made our own christian capable ofsuch infamous conduct as surely as my name is george lory seven years chasseur in the army offrance i would run him through the body with my saber ﬂ terrible to look upon he half rose from his chair and pointed to his long chasseur ™ s saber which hungunder a picture of his son in the uniform of a zouave taken out there in africabut merely to look at that honest alsatian face š burned almost black by the sun the strong lightmaking the colours stand out vividly against the blank whiteness around š that was enough to quiet himsuddenlyhe began to laugh ﬁ i am a fine fellow to be losing my head this wayas if our christian could dream of turningprussian š christian who bowled over such a lot of them in the war ﬂ brought back to good humour by this idea the good smith managed to make a cheerful meal and setout right after it to empty a couple of glasses at the ville de strasbourgthe old woman was now left aloneshe had put the small blond scamps to bed they could be heardtwittering in the next room like a nestful of birds getting ready for sleepshe picked up her work and setto darning before the door on the garden side of the houseonce in a while she sighed and she thought ﬁ of course š there can be no doubt of it š they are scoundrels and renegades š but what of ittheirmothers are glad to see them again ﬂ and she thought of the time when her own boy had not yet gone to join the army and stood there just atthat hour of the day getting ready to work in the gardenshe looked at the well where he refilled hiswatering cans her boy in his blouse with his long hair that beautiful hair which had been cut shortwhen he entered the zouavessuddenly she trembledthe little gate at the back š the gate which led to the fields š had been openedthe dogs had not barked though the man who had just entered slunk along the walk like a thief andslipped in among the beehives ﬁ goodday mother ﬂ his uniform all awry there stood before her christian her son anxious shamefaced andthicktonguedthe wretched boy had come back with the others and for the last hour had been prowlingabout the house waiting for his father to go outshe wanted to scold him but she had not the couragehow long it was since she had seen him had hugged himand then he went on to give her such goodreasons for his return š how he had grown weary for his native countryside for the smithy š weary ofliving always so far away from them all and of the discipline š much harsher of late š as well as of hiscomrades who called him ﬁ prussian ﬂ because of his alsatian accentshe believed every word he saidshe had only to look at him to believe himdeep in their talk they went into the lower roomthe littleones woke up and ran in their nightshirts and bare feet to embrace the big brotherhe was urged to eatbut he was not hungryhe was only thirsty always thirsty and he gulped great draughts of water on topof all the beer and white wine for which he had paid that morning at the innbut some one was coming into the yardit was the blacksmith returning ﬁ christian here comes your fatherquick hide until i have time to talk with him and explain ﬂ she pushed the boy behind the great porcelain stove and again set herself to sewing with tremblinghandsbut as ill fortune would have it the zouave ™ s cap lay upon the table and it was the first thinglory noticed as he enteredthe mother ™ s pallor and her agitation š he understood it all ﬁ christian is here ﬂ he cried in a terrible voicetaking down his saber with a mad gesture he rushedtowards the stove where crouched the zouave pale sobered and steadying himself against the wall tokeep from fallingthe mother threw herself between them ﬁ lory lorydon ™ t kill himhe came back because i wrote that you needed him at the forge ﬂ she riveted her hold upon his arm and dragged him back sobbingthe children in the darkness oftheir room began to cry when they heard those voices full of anger and tears and so thick that they didnot know themthe smith stood still and looked at his wife ﬁ oh ﬂ he said ﬁ so it was you who made him come backvery wellit is time he went to bedi shalldecide tomorrow what i must do ﬂ christian woke next morning from a sleep filled with nightmares and broken by causeless terrors tofind himself in the room he had used as a childalready warm and well up in the sky the sun sent itsrays across the blossoming hops and through the small leaded panes of the windowhammers wereringing on the anvil belowhis mother sat by his pillow she had been so afraid of her husband ™ s angerthat she had not stirred from there all nightnor had the father gone to bedtill the first dawn he hadwalked through the house weeping sighing opening and closing closetshe now entered his son ™ s roomhe was very grave and dressed for a journeyhe wore his high gaiters and his big hat and carried hisheavy mountain stick with its iron ferulehe went straight to the bed ﬁ come get up ﬂ dazed the boy made as if to get his zouave equipment ﬁ no not that ﬂ said the father sternlythe mother all apprehension said ﬁ but my dear he has no other things ﬂ ﬁ give him minei shall not need them again ﬂ while the boy dressed lory carefully packed the uniform with its little vest and its huge red trousersas soon as he had made the package he slung about his neck the tin box which contained the schedule ofcoaches ﬁ now let us go down ﬂ he said and all three without a word descended to the smithythe blast roaredeveryone was at workwhen christian saw once more that great open shed of whichhe had so often thought off there in algeria he recalled his childhood and the long hours he had playedout there between the heat of the road and the sparks from the forge that glittered amid the black dusthe felt a sudden flood of tenderness a great longing to be pardoned by his father but whenever he raisedhis eyes he met an inexorable lookat last the blacksmith made up his mind to speak ﬁ boy ﬂ he said ﬁ there stands the anvil with the toolsthey are all yoursand so is all this ﬂ heindicated the little garden which lay beyond filled with sunshine and with bees and framed by the sootysquare of the door ﬁ the hives the vine the house itself š they are all yoursyou sacrificed your honour for these thingsthe least you can do is to take care of themnow you are
